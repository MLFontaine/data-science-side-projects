 My kid has become obsessed with flashlights, which makes sense because I've NEVER stopped enjoying playing with flashlights. Seriously, flashlights are awesome. You can shine them directly in people's eyes. You can point them at the wall and shake them to make cool patterns. LOOK! A CIRCLE OF LIGHT! You can take them into the woods and pretend you're a detective looking for a corpse. I love flashlights in every way. I love taking them into the basement and pretending I'm going down into a city sewer, preparing to confront some grisly subterranean beast. Because you never know in the dark. Do you? One second, your flashlight is shining on the dryer. The next second, you're turning the corner and BOOM! Fucking vampire at 11 o'clock. With flashlights, life becomes one giant horror movie.
</p>
<p>
 So, by all means, go out, get drunk and stoned, and play with flashlights, people. That's what they're for. Now, the letters.

  I wanted to ask you about the act of child-birth, more specifically, the Dad's role during this momentous occasion. Is it no longer acceptable for the Dad to remain in the waiting room passing out cigars? And if you must be by her side, is it possible to avoid having to look at &lsquo;ground zero'?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Men are expected to be in the delivery room (you want to be there, I assure you), and are expected to help with the pushing. That is to say, you will be expected to take your wife's leg (the nurse takes the other), bring her knee to her ear, and count to ten as she tries to squeeze the child out. This can last for hours, and it's fucking brutal on your back. Of course, you can't complain that your back hurts during this, because your wife will be attempting to push a human child out of her cervix. Fair enough.
</p>
<p>
 Now, I went to childbirth class with the Mrs. on our first kid (no parent does this with the second kid, because once you have the kid you realize how pointless the class was). In this class, they forced us to watch videos of live births. It was horrifying. It was the worst porno I've ever seen. Apparently, they were all shot in 1986 on the lowest quality videotape humanly possible. Every woman they selected had Linda Hamilton's
 <em>
  Terminator
 </em>
 mullet. All of them were sweating. One was buck naked on the table. One was naked and squatting on the table, trying to poop the baby out. And many of the babies came out covered in a white, waxy substance called vernix that makes the child look like a creature from
 <em>
  Ghoulies
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 These movies were traumatizing to me, but they drove the point home that every man needs to know: Never look at ground zero. I covered this over at
 <a href="http://fatherknowsshit.blogspot.com/2006/02/labor-or-why-im-glad-im-not-woman.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  FKS,
 </a>
 but it bears repeating: keep your eyes focused on your wife's face. You will be tempted to look down. Do not. It's like when they open the Ark of the Covenant in
 <em>
  Raiders
 </em>
 . You don't want to look right at it. Your head will melt. Also, by staring at your wife's face, you give HER something to look at, instead of staring down at her own business. Think childbirth is scary to watch? Imagine being the one in the stirrups.
</p>
<p>
 You will be stunned by the amount of blood that comes out during birth. It's insane. I can only speak for my experience, but there was blood everywhere. EVERYWHERE. In the fucking corner of the room, yards away from my wife. On the fucking ceiling. And I was like, "How the fuck did blood get there?" Well, it did somehow. The room was painted with stuff. I spent hours and hours staring at my wife, only to turn around and see red all over. I nearly collapsed. Mothers are quite something.
</p>
<p>
 One funny aside to this: My wife received an epidural for birth, and it was hospital policy that the husband remain seated during the injection, lest he pass out from watching it (which I was told had happened on occasion). Yet, during the actual birth, you can stand all you like. You can do jumping jacks, for all they care. Seems inconsistent. Because I nearly passed out, and I didn't even have to give birth to the thing.
</p>
<p>
 Our second kid was born C-section. The erect a curtain at your wife's waist. I was not allowed to take a peek behind it. In some ways, this was worse, because my wife and I were sitting on one side of the curtain, and we knew EXACTLY what was going on. You could see the blood spattering the doctor's faces. You could hear, well, gushing sounds as he moved his hands around. I mean, holy fucking shit. You know the other side of that curtain is hosting a butchering. It's a horrible, horrible sensation. And again, that's just from the husband's perspective. I wasn't even the one being slit open. My wife passed out from blood loss and nausea. She was walking a day later. Again, women are quite the strong gender.
</p>
<p>
 Of course, children are well worth all this. And frankly, it's worth going through the experience because HOLY FUCK THIS IS FUCKING LIFE AND DEATH. You feel like you're in the middle of an episode of ER, only the doctors NEVER FUCKING SHOW UP. Plus, you get to share your story with soon-to-be parents, and scare the ever-living fuck out of them. ENJOY!

  Do you have an overwhelming desire to steal when using the self checkout at grocery stores?

<p>
 Yup. I've been subject to checks they run to ensure that I am NOT stealing, where the clerk comes by and randomly scans a few things in the basket (because I use the self-scanner gun too).
</p>
<p>
 I feel a certain amount of stealing at self-checkout is acceptable. Remember: you're saving the store money by cutting on employee wages and benefits by using self-checkout. That, to me, is worth a free bakery item. If I can't find the item on your fucking store's menu, then tough shit. It's mine. I'm either it taking it, or I'm scanning it as something cheaper. Jerusalem artichokes become red delicious apples with a simple push of a button. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

<p>
 The dishwasher one. Because I am always ambushed with a clean dishwaher. ALWAYS. I'll be sitting there, cooking dinner, then I go to throw something in the dishwasher&hellip; BOOM! All clean! INSTANT FUCKING CHORE. God, I hate that. And it happens virtually any time I waltz into the kitchen. "Oh, honey. The dishwasher is done. Can you&hellip;" SHIT. So experiencing the opposite of that is downright orgasmic.
</p>
<p>
 You know what I hate most about emptying the dishwasher? The shit that doesn't dry. The dishwasher will dry many things: plates, etc. But a fucking plastic bowl? No chance. Sopping wet when I pull it out. And sometime I get glasses that are still wet. The whole thing becomes a fucking drying party. KILL KILL KILL. Then there are items like coffee cups that have just enough of a depression in the bottom that they can accumulate a small tidal pool of water in them during the cycle. I fucking hate items like this. That shit spills all over the other dishes, and now I have to dry every goddamn thing. All cups and bowls should have flat bottoms. Always. Fucking gravy boat. You are DEAD TO ME.

  I have 3 kids under 6. I feel more confident in the ability of our baby gates to keep out intruders than the deadbolt on our door. You could surround the Hope diamond with four baby gates and it would be safe. You ever watch a person without kids try and figure out how to open one of those gates? Even if you have kids, if the gate is a different brand than yours, it takes a good couple minutes of maneuvering and cursing before you finally just try to (always ungracefully) step over the thing.
 </p>

<p>
 The worst are pressure gates. People have these for dogs and kids. Instead of a mounted gate, which you screw into the wall and can swing open and closed, you have to push down pressure gates so they press against the wall. These are cheap, shitty gates, and I would fucking burn them all if I were allowed. They're impossible to remove. They're even harder to redo. They're just fucking ass. Then I try stepping over it, clip my foot on the top dislodge it, trip over it, and then go falling to my death. Got a kid? Got a dog? Have the courtesy to use a fucking mounted gate.

I'll try to run the card through again as if it will magically work the second time, knowing goddamn well it's going to get turned down again. On February 15th I was buying groceries and it happened to me. I got the fuck out of there as quickly as I could.

 The worst part is then calling the company or checking the ATM to ensure that it was mistake, only to slowly realize no, it was no mistake. You are fucking dead broke, and this is exactly how you were able to pull off the feat.

 The worst thing about having sick kids or a sick wife/girlfriend is that the "no touching the food or glasses" of others policy is immediately implemented by your woman. 40% of my food and fluid intake comes from the plates and glasses of others. I can't live if I can't steal my wife's food or eat the shit my kids won't. I have to be reminded of this policy 90 times a day when my wife sick. UH UH UH! NO DRINKING FROM MY GLASS! AND NO SEX!

 Yes, and this applies to more than just cheese. If I'm eating a sundae, I try and save the section with the most hot fudge for last. If I'm eating an omelet, I try and save the bite with most filling for last. If I'm eating a cinnamon roll, I try and save the part with the most frosting and cinnamon crap for last.

 Yes. The question is&hellip; do you eat it? Because I'll eat hand and arm skin. But toejam is where I draw the line.

<p>
 When I was a kid, I was fascinated with the skin of my heel, because that's where skin is the thickest. I used to dig a pen into the back of my heel and rip away shreds of the heel skin, just to see how thick it was. And it was insanely thick. Like a wrestling mat. One time I put it in my mouth. Like leather. I didn't make the same mistake twice. That would have been, you know, gross and stuff.
</p>
<p>
 If you have a stray piece of skin or nail hanging off your body, who can resist pulling it off? I mean, really. I knew a kid once who had a broken toenail and he just left the nail dangling there, still on his toe. Half ripped off. Who does this? Who has that willpower? I wanted to hold that fucker down and rip that fucking nail right off.

<p>
 Opening a new jar of peanut butter is great because you get the pristine surface AND you get the sound of the vacuum seal coming undone. I love that sound, like when you open a jar of dry roasted peanuts. VOOP! It won't be long until you are in PeanutLand. Same with new containers of hummus (great because they're super flat) and tubs of ice cream.
</p>
<p>
 All peanut butter jars should be designed as upside down trapezoids, with a really wide mouth. That gives you more surface to dig into, plus leaves more room for your hand as you dig deeper.

 No. Most videogames are now designed for grownups. More grownups play them than kids. Getting pissed at someone for liking video games is like being pissed at them for liking movies.
</p>
<p>
 The only reason your chick is pissed is because video games take up more time than movies or TV, and she can't play it with you because she probably is very bad at playing them.

 Um, Australia? Have you considered Australia? You should go to Australia. Sure, I'm terrified of spiders that can fly and carry firearms, but that doesn't mean you are. Go. I've never heard of anyone who went abroad to Australia and came back saying, "God, that sucked. I wish I'd stayed in Cleveland." No one says that, because that would be insane. Everyone I've seen come back from Australia looks tan, and more attractive, and they GLOW with contentment. They didn't have to learn some goddamn foreign language. They just drank and made friends and screwed and basically spent four months in Eden.

 If you're strictly looking into Europe, I went to England. It was awesome. I recommend it. Spain and Italy are filled with great food but tons of Catholic women. You'll only have sex with other American students, which I guess is, uh... not optimal? Aw hell, you can't go wrong. Even if you go to Germany, which is filled with nothing but fucking bossy weirdos. Just leave America. Go anywhere. Leave our shores and don't come back until you're drunk and happy.

  I went an all-male Catholic high school. One day in 10th grade English, one of the guys pulled out a sheet of notebook paper and proceeded to wipe a neon green gem that he'd been mining for a while. He wrote "Booger Paper" at the top and passed it on. Within minutes there must have been 20 or so nose nuggets of all various shapes, sizes, colors, and consistencies. Everybody put their initials next to their work for the others to admire. I told my wife this story and she gave me the "I don't know who you are anymore" look. She blames most of my disgusting behavior on that school.

Walk to the bedroom and hear a muffled sound and walk on the other side of the bed and she'd on the floor eyes closed and using a vibrator. All I could say was "whoa" and walk right out. WHY DID I WALK OUT? Should I have stayed and helped out? Should I have just treated it as a race and tried to beat her to the finish?

 Porn training demands you whip out your penis and say, "You look like you could use some help." You probably interrupted her in an extremely private moment and scared the piss out of her, therefore destroying her mood. Just one of the many ways life is a total letdown from porn.

 I used to have that fantasy all the time when I was a kid. I'd walk into a house or classroom and stumble upon some horny lass pleasuring herself, just wishing there was a man around with a working penis to assist her in getting some relief. I did not, nor have I ever, actually stumbled upon such a scenario.

 I've also had the reverse fantasy, where I'm caught masturbating, only I'm caught by a sexy lady who is intrigued rather than disgusted. Again, "You look like you could use some help." THEN IT'S ON!

  As a kid, a public bathroom's urinal or toilet would often have discarded cigarette butts or better yet half smoked cigarettes. Was there anything better than breaking up the rolling paper and dispersing the tobacco, or if your stream was on that day, the rare nirvana of breaking the filter? Sadly, once restaurants and several other public places got rid of smoking in their premises, there has been a lack of opportunities to engage in cigarette destruction.

 There is a rare pleasure to be had in pissing on things. If someone were to produce a biodegradable, pipe-friendly series of urinary targets &ndash; small figurines of men, women, dogs, terrorists, Jason McIntyre &ndash; for you to piss on, I would buy such a thing. Pissing on things, particularly destroying or dissolving things with your stream, is a pleasure only men can know.

 Even worse than fries in the car is pizza. I will drive 10 mph faster with pizza smell wafting through the car. I pick up the pizza, stick in the passenger seat, get in the other side, close the door, and GOOD LORD THAT SMELLS FANTASTIC. Agony to drive with pizza in the car.

 What would complicate this question is abortion. What is the largest number of abortions one groupie has ever had? Remember: multiple abortions can leave a woman sterile.

I can be fixing shit around the house or watching TV. Also, as an English teacher, I have stupid essays to grade. I want to spend time with my wife when we can talk, not whisper. Also, if I lay on the floor I am likely to fall asleep, and then she gets mad at me for falling asleep. When it is my turn, I suggest she can go downstairs, hoping she gets the hint, but she never does.

 That's completely unreasonable. The whole point of there being TWO of you is so that one of you is free to live a normal life while the other is stuck with the child.

  If you were being chased by someone, and you were both on foot, what do you think would be the coolest way to get away from them? You could leap from a bridge onto a boat passing underneath. You could run and jump onto a moving train, either onto the caboose from behind or, if it's a freight train, into a random boxcar that happens to have the door open. If I were being chased I would like a ski lift to be involved somehow. If they followed you onto the lift you would have the options of continuing to run once you reached the top, leaping off the lift at some point and risking the 20 foot drop, or maybe even surprising them at the top. Lots of possibilities.
 </p>

 I like the moving train or bus. Remember: all buses have that hatch in the top. You could totally open the hatch, drop down, commandeer the bus from the driver, and then drive it through a fruit cart and a plate of glass.

 I also like to incorporate Parkour into my fantasy. In my imagination, I have Jackie Chan's agility, and can therefore leap on top of that dumpster and then fly over that chain link fence in one graceful motion. In reality, it would take me 7 hours to do this. This is what the imagination is for.

 Guns also have to be involved. You have a gun. Your pursuer has a gun. And you have to hide behind an oil barrel every twenty feet or so and engage in a brief gunfight before moving ahead.

  I work in a single floor building. It's an old warehouse that was converted to office spaces so while it's single floor, there's probably 8 feet above the ceiling to the roof. It's mostly crammed with wires and plumbing up there.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other day I was slacking off walking around the building when I decided to check out the old cafeteria that closed a few years ago. I went in the back area of the cafeteria and found doorway-sized cubbyholes that were obviously lockers for the old cafeteria staff. But the last locker area had two stairs and then a bend to the left with about 6 more stairs. I couldn't help but follow them.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guess what's at the top of the stairs? A brand fucking new unisex bathroom with one urinal, one throne, a sink and a locking door! Obviously built just for the cafeteria staff. It's completely secluded and since there's no cafeteria staff anymore, no one uses that area. All the lights are kept off. I feel like I've found the hidden 13th floor of a hotel or that hidden train platform to Hogwarts. Needless to say, I never shit at home anymore. I always take my trips to the second floor bathroom in my one floor building. I am so happy I will never leave my job. One downside is that I will have to kill anyone I find using that bathroom.

 I spent my entire childhood hoping to find secret passages in both my house and any other building I entered. I scoured walls. I pulled books halfway out of bookcases to see if a latch was caught.

You watch. One day I'll disappear. And you'll never hear from me again, because I'll be fighting Tiamat.
