 I was watching "Archer" the other night and they had Archer's mom stranded on a shitty fishing boat that was named CHUM GUZZLER. That's a fucking win. Onto the letters.

 <p>
  Do you ever pull off the road when it's just fucking pouring rain?
 </p>
 <p>
  It was like a switch went off when I hit my 30's and my body suddenly stopped producing whatever substance I needed to not be worried about possibly hydroplaning into a fucking gas tanker (testosterone? Please, God, no). I know it's sort of shameful to admit, but I sometimes get totally terrified driving in a storm, especially on the highway.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last fall, there was a massive rainstorm here, and I was driving on a two-lane state highway (speed limit 55) at about 45-50 mph when some asshole in a Scion or some shit came blazing up behind me and flicked his brights a couple times as if he wanted me to speed up. I felt my heartbeat quadruple, and I pulled off the road in a panic. What's worse is that I had to just sit there for a solid minute after he passed so that my pulse could slow down.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jesus, I think I should take a baby aspirin just thinking about it.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I've never pulled over for rain. It's one of those moves that make a good amount of sense, but I have way too much foolish pride to go through with it. Also, every man on a road trip is a slave to the desire to make good time. What did I do the trip in last time? Four hours? FUCK THAT, I'M BEATING IT. If I'm pulling over and adding precious minutes to my arrival time, it better be because there's a turtle about to crawl out of my ass, or because my bladder is about to burst into a thousand pieces, or because I developed a sudden urge for Taco Bell and MUST pull over should the Taco Bell sign appear. Pull over for rain? Waste precious minutes ensuring that I don't die? NEVER. Can't be done.
</p>
<p>
 I've had those rain drives where you go along for two hours and the rain just doesn't ever let the fuck up. You're like, "Well, it can't possibly stay pouring like this forever." BUT IT DOES! You can feel your eyes begin to melt into your brain. You scoot up in your car seat to stay alert. You practically press your fucking face against the windshield. The relentless patter on the car roof beckons you to nod off and go skidding down an embankment. Those are times when it would make a modicum of sense to go ahead, admit defeat, and just pull over for a second to regain consciousness. But I never do. And that is because I am retarded.

  Have you ever had an in-grown face hair? Are these things common among normal folk? I got my first one a few weeks ago &mdash; and I'm not talking your run of the mill pimple. When I dug this sucker out the first time my findings were so gruesome and bewildering that I repressed and almost forgot the incident entirely. Today I got another one, and this time I played for keeps. This fucking mutant strand of hair had the girth of refillable pencil lead. A single hair I tell you! What gives?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I don't get ingrown hairs very often, but I get really fucking excited when it happens. Because, first off, I get to dig into my own skin with tweezers. It's like mining my own body, which is an odd yet gratifying feeling. Secondly, there's no telling what I might find. I'm always SHOCKED at long the hair is. I mean, you dig in there, you get a grip, and you hoist the fucker out, and it is INCHES long. Looks like the end of a coat hanger after an abortion. It's unreal. That's been growing in my body this whole time? Holy fuck. That is like the tentacle of an alien.
</p>
<p>
 The thick hairs are even more disturbing. I feel like I'm turning into "The Fly" when that happens. I remember Geena Davis seeing a hair on Jeff Goldblum's back right after he gets out of the transporter, and she like, "Wow, that's really coarse!" And shit goes way fucking downhill from that moment on.
</p>
<p>
 I also enjoy getting that little squiggle of pus erupting out. So cute. It's like pasta! Pusta!

 <p>
  I've got a big fireplace that'll warm 2 or 3 rooms, depending on how big I can get the fire. But, what made this fire particularly awesome was the fact that I had just spent a couple days cleaning out my home office and had a ton of old bank statements that I was intending to get rid of. Rather than shred them and then toss them (as a one-time victim of identity theft I am ultra-paranoid about it happening again), we decided to use the old statements as kindling. There is nothing more fun than throwing official-looking documents into a fire. Makes you feel like a super-villain. "Well, this document could save the orphanage. Too bad it'll never get to the authorities."
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 That is awesome. We gets cards for birthdays and shit and I always want to toss them into the fire and pretend I'm a guy trying to get over a really fantastic ex-girlfriend. OUR LOVE IS NOTHING MORE NOW THAN FINE ASH. I never got a chance to do that when I was younger. Just milk a fucking terrible breakup for all the drama and pathetic self-pity I could possibly muster. That would be fun as shit.
</p>
<p>
 I can't get the Mrs. to go along with this, because she says it'll send a message to the kids that they can just throw anything in the fireplace. It's a good point, but still. There's nothing more enjoyable than throwing shit in a fireplace that isn't supposed to go into the fireplace, like the following items:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Old wreaths
 <br/>
 &bull; Photos
 <br/>
 &bull; Clementine orange crates
 <br/>
 &bull; Magazines
 <br/>
 &bull; Hookers
</p>
<p>
 The list is endless. I may be 33 years old, but I will never stop enjoying the act of burning shit. It's intoxicating. One day, when I have a billion dollars and the kids have moved out, I'm buying an outdoor fireplace. One of those big brass bowls you can stick on a patio. Then I'm going to drunk every night and just throw random shit into it. I can't wait. I'd buy a time machine now to get to that point. FIRE IS AWESOME.

 Sean:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Our office services have thoughtfully equipped our restrooms with those mondo 20,000+ sheet rolls of TP. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about having a plethora of single ply tissue at my disposal (especially after that 12:30 burrito) but the rub here is when you get dealt a roll with an uneven cardboard tube circumference. This may not pose a problem for normal people who gingerly gather the toilet paper a few sheets at a time, but I like to give it a good "price is right" spin so the streaming ribbon of TP doubles on itself for optimal hand and cheek coverage. This, in turn, causes a calamitous "clunka-clunka-clunk" as the roll enters a death spin, garnering much unwanted attention for your exit of the restroom. And the thing is, you have to wait until all the fucking sheets are gone! What's that, like 3 weeks? I'm not going to change my routine for a bum roll, can't we invent some kind of suspension system for these goliath toilet paper rolls?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Even worse, sometimes the roll gets so deformed that the roll stops mid-pull, so the TP instantly tears. It doesn't even tear at the perforated edge. Just a little piddly shit patch the size of your thumbprint. I've had some of those giant rolls not budge at all, then I have to dig into the giant plastic roll holder with my hand and painstaking roll the TP manually, like I'm Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the mountain. That's hard work!
</p>
<p>
 A lot of those holders are cheaply made, so even if you get a relatively perfect roll and inner tube, the sides of the plastic case may press too hard against the sides of the giant roll, making it hard to pull. Or the TP is so thin and cheap that it tears from the simple act of pulling.
</p>
<p>
 This isn't even the domain of giant rolls. Sometimes, I go into a shitter, and it's a normal roll of cheap toilet paper. But the holder is some piece of shit metal thing where the axle snaps into the side of the holder, only the metal gets warped and the fucking roll is frozen in place. I can't even roll it by hand.
</p>
<p>
 These are tragic situations in the shitter, because like Sean I like giving the toilet paper a firm tug. LOOK AT HOW STRONG I AM! You should at least be able to walk into a public shitter and have a chance to do that.

 <p>
  When are you too old to drink chocolate milk? And when are you too old to make your own chocolate milk by mixing in Hershey's syrup?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Never. My kid will only drink milk if I mix Ovaltine into it. And she drinks whole milk, so what I usually do is mix a full cup of Ovaltine, drink the shit out of it, and then refill it halfway with a new batch. When you spend your whole 20's drinking skim milk, if any milk at all, that return to chocolate milk is fucking tremendous. God dammit, it tastes good.
</p>
<p>
 When I was a kid, I used to put an unholy amount of Hershey's Syrup in my milk. Just an obnoxious amount. A quarter of the fucking bottle. The milk was black by the time I was finished. And I used to purposely leave it somewhat unmixed so that I knew I had a thick batch of pure syrup awaiting me at the bottom of the glass. Fat kids are creative like that.

 <p>
  When making a pizza yourself, do you actually leave a crust, or like me, do you pile toppings all the way to the edge only to have them slide off as soon as the cheese starts melting? This leads to me having to clean my oven every time I make a pizza, yet for some reason I can't stop doing it.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Parchment paper, my friend. Buy parchment paper. It will save your fucking life. Everything I stick in the oven now has a sheet of parchment paper underneath it. You'll never have to scrub a fucking cookie sheet clean again. It's glorious. Plus, I like unspooling the parchment and pretending that I'm about to draft an old historical document. WE THE PEOPLE and what have you. "And ye on the second day yon every June, a wench shall bring forth tankards of lager for all ye townsfolke."
</p>
<p>
 I've gotten better at making my own pizza. Two things improve it immeasurably. One: Drizzle olive oil on top before you stick it in the oven. Two: Buy a Microplane and grate fresh parmesan reggiano over the thing before you stick it in the oven. It makes it extra nice.

 <p>
  Would you ever consider giving it a whirl with Roxxxy the sex robot or would that be way too weird?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 If I were single and desperate? And it was gift? Sure. May as well. Somebody's gotta test the sexbot. May as well be me.
</p>
<p>
 When I was in dipshit prep school, we had a Secret Santa thing every December in which we all exchanged gifts, only the gifts were supposed to be cruel and spiteful. I gave one kid a Tupperware filled with my own shit once. You get the idea. Anyway, some guys pitched in and bought some kid an inflatable sex doll. The kind with hole for sticking it in the mouth and anus and all that. Anyway, the kid who got it was insulted that he would be considered so desperate, so he immediately tossed the dummy on the floor of my room. And I kept it there, because I didn't particularly care about the state of my floor. Prep school dorm room floors are disgusting like that: sex dolls, old food, piss, spittle. Nothing gets thrown out. It's a garbage dump with a carpet underneath.
</p>
<p>
 Now, I never had sex with the doll. And trust me, I'd gladly tell you if I had. I mean, I wrote in a published book that I banged a peach. It's not like I have anything to hide here. I didn't even bother to try fucking the doll, because the doll was extremely cheap and rubbing your penis against it was sure to be as painful as rubbing it against the inside of a balloon. And it didn't even look like a girl. It looked like a creepy mime doll or something. It wasn't like it turned you on it if you looked at it.
</p>
<p>
 So I left it there and didn't pay it much heed. Cut to after Winter Break. My folks drive me up to school, help me take my shit up to my room, open the door, and there's Peggy Poundmouth sitting on the floor.
</p>
<p>
 Now, if you were a parent, and you saw this, and your son told you he never actually used it, would you believe him? Of course you wouldn't. You'd assume the kid spent 20 hours a day painting that thing for all it's worth. And so, for the past two decades, my folks have been under the mistaken assumption that I spent a majority of my time at school banging the shit out of this doll. BUT I DIDN'T! I SWEAR! I WAS TOO BUSY JACKING IT IN CLASS! IT'S TRUE, MOM!

 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I'm an odd human being in that I only like pickles on a McDonald's hamburger and in no other venue. I can't think of another food that has such specific limits on it in my repertoire, except for maybe raw tomatoes (love them in salsa, hate them in all other venues). No clue why I'm like this. I wish I just liked EVERY food. I hate having to worry about whether or not some fuckface put mayo on my sandwich.

 JimmyFax:

 <p>
  I live in NYC, so I take the subway every day and those fuckers stop between stations ALL THE TIME. Each and every time this happens, I always immediately scan the entire subway car I'm in and picture which girls I would savage in which order if we were stranded there for the rest of eternity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I scan the car of the dudes and rank them, relative to myself, in how effective a leader they would be for our group in this post-apocalyptic future I'm imagining (age, physical stature, ability to communicate in English* and intelligence* are all factors). Then, finally, I cross-rank what dudes might be able to sidle up to some of the sweeter chicks first and try to figure out which chick I would actually end up with. Obviously with this part, I try to filter out blatant homosexuals from both side of the gender equation.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have to say, I tend to always put myself very near the top of the lists in both "possible leader" and "possible mates" categories. It's always awesome when I'm the clear #1 in both, but equally brutal when I realize that I'm in a car where I'd probably be ending up with the chunky brunette that doesn't brush her hair.
 </p>

<p>
 A long time ago, I went to the theater and saw a piece of shit Stallone movie called
 <em>
  Daylight.
 </em>
 If you've seen that movie, you know the premise is that the Lincoln Tunnel has been sealed at both ends, and the people trapped inside are trying to find a way out. Any time I enter any sort of underground tunnel, in my car or on the subway, I immediately think of this movie and picture myself having to lead a group of people out of a manhole with my trusty trunk flare. Then the "Judging Amy" chick and I go at it.
</p>
<p>
 Then there's that fear that you WON'T find a way out. That you'll be trapped underground forever and forced to create your own sickening and inbred moleperson society. I saw a trailer once for a documentary called "Dark Days" about people who live in the NYC subway tunnels. There's a small number of them, and they've been living down there for God knows how long. Completely freaks me out. I used to go down into any NYC Subway station and imagine one of the molepeople running out of the tunnel and coming to feast on my brains.
</p>
<p>
 By the way, like JimmyFax, I would completely envision myself as the alpha dog of a stranded subway car. The truth, of course, is that I would stand there like a fucking moron and do virtually anything anyone around me told me to do. We got stuck in the snow the other day on our road. Three people came to help. I ended up nearly running one of them over and launching shovelfuls of snow at the other two by accident. In emergencies, my IQ drops 85 points.

 <p>
  I'm starting to shop for an engagement ring for my lady. Any advice? (Other then get the damn thing on her finger as soon as humanly possible?) Thanks.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Yeah, ask her what kind of engagement ring she wants. Most women are nice enough to accept any ring you give them. If your lady throws your ring back in your face and demands something else, you probably don't want to marry her.
</p>
<p>
 All that said, it doesn't mean you SHOULD just get her any ring you come across. Most couples, before a proposal, have talked about getting married. All around you, there are probably friends and relatives who are also in the act of getting married or engaged. Always ask your lady if she likes the ring your friend's new wife has or whatever. She'll always give you enough hints for you to figure out what to buy. You can even ask her cold about what kind of ring she wants. Don't go in blind. Having an idea of what she wants helps narrow the search considerably.
</p>
<p>
 Also, go to Tiffany's or some outlandishly expensive place and ask the clerk for advice. They know their shit, much more than I did. They'll give you some pamphlet about the four C's and certification and all that crap. Then you can figure out what looks good and buy the ring someplace much cheaper. I went to Tiffany's and did this. The clerk knew immediately that I was a cheapskate and a moron.
</p>
<p>
 ME: What about a ring with briquettes on the side?
</p>
<p>
 CLERK: You mean baguettes?

<p>
 CLERK: Should I ring this one up?

  Two summers ago I was driving across the country on a monster road trip, and as I'm driving through Nevada at night, I passed several signs on a highway in Nevada that said "OPEN RANGE" and had a cow symbol on them. So apparently it's not required that farmers in Nevada fence off their cattle from the highway. I spent miles and miles seriously worried that a cow was going to wander out in front of me and I was going to smash into it at 70 miles an hour. Have you ever had to drive through OPEN RANGE territory?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 No, but that would terrify me. I mean, I understand why it would be hard for some Nevada rancher to fence off 560,000 acres of land or whatever, but hitting a cow would be thoroughly unpleasant. Look at this video of a car clipping a fucking cow.

  What if I'm ever sent back in time a few years, and the only way I can use my knowledge of the future and assume a normal life is to kill the version of me that's living in the past? How would I do it? Would I even have the guts to go through with it? I'd have the ultimate advantage of knowing the exact routine of past-me and when and where I'd be at all times. I'd also know all of past-me's weaknesses and how to exploit them. All of this has instilled me with the irrational fear that a future version of myself could be around any corner waiting to eliminate me.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 But that makes no sense. If future you killed present you, there wouldn't be a present you. Much more terrifying is the prospect that someone close to you in the future will be sent to kill you.
</p>
<p>
 I would be a particularly easy mark. I'm easy to spot, due to my size. I'm slow. My movements are predictable. And I'm completely oblivious to anything going on outside of my own head. My wife could be five feet away in a department store, screaming ta me to get my attention, and the hamster wheel in my head is still just spinning round and round, completely unaware. You could kill me in an instant.

 Yeah, but icicles are more fragile than you realize. They're extremely brittle, and the tip breaks off at the slightest touch. Bruce Willis killed a dude with an icicle in

  For inefficient use of hygiene products, shaving cream has nothing on dental floss - I wrap that sucker twenty times around my fingers and only use 1/16th of a inch to actually floss (I only floss right before I go to the dentist so while the per-use efficiency is terrible, the per-day efficiency of the floss is still pretty good)

 Use flossers. I fucking hate real floss. Granted, I enjoy winding string around my fingertip until it turns purple. That's a fun thing to do and I used to do it when I was a kid all the time.

 Nah. Don't let us fool you. Half the fun of having kids is bitching about them.

 The hard truth is that kids are fucking awesome. THEY BABBLE! THEY LOOK LIKE YOU! CHICKS DIG THEM! THEY SAY STUPID SHIT THAT'S FUNNY! The pluses far outweigh the minuses. Even when having kids SUCKS, and it does sometimes, it's worth it. Sometimes, I'll have to go in to feed the kid at 4AM or something, and I'll be sitting there in the dark, and my eyes will have adjusted to the dark, and the kid will finish eating, and he'll rest his head on my shoulder. Then, he'll pop up and give me a look. He'll just stare right at me. And looking at the kid in that moment&hellip; it's something. Like someone took a piece of your soul and crafted it into another living being. It's mindblowing.
</p>

 Besides, you have nothing better to do. After a few years, you have nothing to talk about with the wife. But now, the Mrs. and I can go out to dinner and spend the whole night bitching about the kids. It's great.

<p>
 One other thing: pictures. You'll love staring at pictures of your kids. Pictures are better than kids, because they don't make noise. Sometimes, the kid will be in the room annoying me, and I'll grab a picture of them, completely ignoring the actual kid. "Look at how cute that kid is. So smiley. So quiet. Much nicer than the insane midget currently clinging to my leg."

  I'm surprised you never mentioned the hero sequence where you're walking with your girl/wife, and some guy pulls a gun and tries to rob you. You act pretty cool, and even say something vaguely condescending to him, hoping to incite his ire. So he walks closer to you, trying to put the gun to your head to raise the threat level. BOOM. You reflexively jab his forearm upward and wrestle the gun from his hand and/or him to the ground.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then, you either hold the gun to him while your newly 'even more attracted to you' girl/wife dials 911, or you simply let him go, with an unspoken warning, and drop the gun down the sewer like a world-weary badass.

 Yeah, saving your woman is a huge fantasy issue. Sometimes, I imagine coming home to my house only to find terrorists have broken in and bound my family to a chair. Then, I must crawl down the chimney, dispatch the terrorists, free my family, then make frantic love to the Mrs. I picture this at least nine times a week.

 One time, I was walking in New York with my wife when a 16-year-old kid jumped out in front of her and screamed AHHHHHHH, scaring her to death. He laughed, and this is the ONLY time in my personal history where I have reacted on impulse and done something mildly aggressive. I pushed the little shit into a nearby pizza parlor and grabbed his lapel. I was SHITFACED.
</p>
<p>
 ME: Was that supposed to be fucking funny, you little piece of shit?
</p>
<p>
 YOU: No.
</p>
<p>
 ME: DON'T YOU EVER FUCKING DO THAT AGAIN, OR I WILL FUCKING RUIN YOU.
</p>
<p>
 YOU: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
</p>
<p>
 ME: FUCKING ASSHOLE.
</p>
<p>
 Then I walked out. The kid apologized to my wife again as I walked out. I felt like fucking Shaft after this. I have NEVER before or since bullied someone and succeeded, because I am a pussy at heart. I still think about that incident at least once a week. I now walk the streets praying for very thin teenagers to try and jump out and scare my wife.

 I do. I am a ROCK GOD when I'm on the elliptical. I've also, in the past, used the angles those mirrors to look at other people's asses without blatant staring.

 We got cartons of milk at my school, but they had always been sitting out for hours at a time. Thus, you'd get a sweaty box of warm-as-doodoo milk. I'd take the bagged milk if I could receive assurances of its coldness. I need my milk cold enough to cause my lips to shatter.

  I had the misfortune of going to a catholic elementary school and was subjected to many odd regulations. One of the more odd rules was that during recess, we weren't allowed to go back inside the building, not even to use the bathroom. So when nature inevitably came calling, we weren't allowed back inside, so I'd sit down on the ground just so I wouldn't poop myself by making any unnecessary movements. What I found was that by sitting on the sun-warmed pavement, the horrible feeling of having to poop would go away in a minute or two and would buy me at least another fifteen minutes of not having to poop. I told all my friends about this 'miracle cure' and before I knew it, every boy on the playground would be sitting on the warm pavement when they had to crap. Trust me: one day, this will save you from crapping your pants in public.

  I have an interesting high school story for you. It begins in English class in 11th grade (1998). It was a slow day and the teacher had granted us a reading day (basically shut the fuck up and leave her alone).
 </p>
 <p>
  I was sitting towards the back of the class reading a book. All of the sudden the girl in the row next to me taps me and another guy in the row and points to the guy in front of her and says he just got finished jerking off. I immediately look at him and notice he appears to be sleeping with his head on his desk. I tell her she is full of it and go back to what I was doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  She insists to both of us that he was definitely jacking it. Of course this news starts to spread around the classroom like wildfire. Out of nowhere the suspect gets up and walks out of class.
 </p>
 <p>
  The young lady who noticed it all proceeds to explain to everyone how he had his hand down his pants and would repeatedly look over his shoulder at her (she had large breasts) while jerking it. The class is in an uproar at this point and the teacher is wondering what all the commotion is about. No one had the heart to tell her. A few minutes later the bell for lunch rings and within 20 minutes the entire school has beard about the jerk session that occurred in English class.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apparently after lunch one of the administrators walked into the classroom and had to explain to the teacher what had happened and remove the desk where the guy had been sitting. He was suspended for three days for leaving class without permission. He came back after suspension and lasted a couple of days before dropping out.
