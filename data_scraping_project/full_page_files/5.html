  The Washington Wizards have the lamest name in sports, correct? I was an 8-year-old boy in D.C. when they made the switch and even I, the demographic they must have been targeting, thought it was stupid... and continue to think that. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the team - but I genuinely believe the name

  influenced fans (and players?) to respect the franchise less. My father refused to call them anything other than the Bullets until just recently.

 They do indeed, even when you factor in the Utah Jazz, who have by far the most incongruous nickname ever. But the nickname &ldquo;Jazz&rdquo; itself is still pretty awesome, even when the team in question consists of Gordon Hayward in a Maroon 5 haircut playing in front 15,000 extras from the set of

 . The Wizards are still lamer, especially given the fact that they just let Kelly Olynyk blow them out of the building. Kelly fucking Olynyk. So glad Boston found itself yet another white folk hero. That crowd was ELATED that Head Shop Delly came to prominence in front of them. I&rsquo;m fucking repulsed.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, it&rsquo;s worth hopping into the wayback machine to remind all you MILLENNIALS in the audience how the Wizards name came to be.

  This old post
 </a>
 from the invaluable Dan Steinberg teases out the history behind the change. Basically, former owner Abe Pollin said he decided to change the name from Bullets after attending the funeral of friend and former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. But in fact, Pollin had been considering the name change months prior to that, supposedly out of sensitivity to gun violence in the District, but perhaps also because Bullets merch sales were in the shitter. So the franchise teamed up with Boston Market (juh?) and held a contest where fans could send in submissions for a new name. (FUN FACT: One of the submissions was
 <a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-12-15/news/9512150012_1_pollin-baltimore-bullets-washington-bullets-basketball" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  Ravens
 </a>
 .) From that list of over 3,000 proposed names, Pollin and the team narrowed it down to five finalists. And, I shit you not, these were the five &ldquo;best&rdquo; choices:
</p>
<p>
 Sea Dogs, Express, Stallions, Dragons, and Wizards.
</p>
<p>
 Look at that list again and despair. There are an infinite number of regionally specific nicknames that you could give a DC sports team, and yet&hellip;Sea Dogs. Jesus. Anyway, fans were invited to vote on the finalists by calling a 900 number that charged you a dollar (proceeds went to charity, but still), and the nickname Wizards &ldquo;won&rdquo; even though Pollin never formally disclosed the voting tally. It&rsquo;s easy to put on your truthering hat and believe that Pollin had no interest in naming the franchise anything other than Wizards, and essentially rigged the vote by offering four other choices that were somehow worse and then picking Wizards regardless of the poll result. Here was how Pollin justified the name after the change was made official:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s someone who can do things,&rdquo; Pollin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s magic, flamboyant, smart and a winner. All those things connote a winner. Once we get the new logo and uniform and colors it&rsquo;ll be fantastic. The NBA has very creative people.&rdquo;
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s impossible to not read that in the Trump voice. If &ldquo;someone who can do things&rdquo; is the baseline for what you look for in a mascot, they may as well have named this team the fucking Line Cooks or something.
</p>
<p>
 By the way, the NBA has a higher concentration of awful team nicknames than any other pro sport, and I say that even knowing that the Houston Texans still exist. I mean, who&rsquo;s gonna take the Toronto Raptors seriously when they&rsquo;re named the Toronto Raptors? You are dooming yourself to an eternity of second round exits any time you give your team some shitty cartoon name like Raptors.

The Ranch Fritos are really hard to find and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen ranch flavored potato chips (maybe Pringles, but those are technically potato crisps).

  ranch potato chips
 </a>
 if you look around hard enough. But you rarely see them in bulk on grocery store shelves, and that&rsquo;s no accident. That is the result of BIG CHIP testing 500 different varieties of beta ranch chip and serving them to focus groups all across the globe and coming to the inevitable conclusion that when people want ranch flavoring, they prefer it in Dorito form. Certain chips have domain over certain flavorings, which is why you never see salt &amp; vinegar Doritos or nacho cheese Tostitos.
</p>
<p>
 Marketers follow consumer preferences, which is how you end up with certain tastes becoming set in stone from store to store and town to town. Chips aside, this is actually a shitty thing because it discourages companies from trying something new and risking having a product flop. The only way consumers roundly approve of new things is if they&rsquo;ve already tried them and liked them.  Safe choices dominate. This is why movies are now terrible.

 (Please note that the Ranch Fritos are extremely tasty, as are ranch pretzel pieces, which have roughly 5,982g of sodium per &frac14; cup).

  I get emails with &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; all the time, and it got me wondering when is the right time to use exclamation points in emails. I think it would be alright among inter-office messages and friends than to outside professionals. Whenever I get an email from an outside email address with &ldquo;THANKS!&rdquo; it always makes me suspicious... Are you really that cheerful at work? Do you enjoy your job that much? Because no reasonable human should be that excited about their 9-to-5. THANKS!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I actually use them more the less I know the person I&rsquo;m emailing. If I&rsquo;m emailing a friend, I can just sign off with GO FUCK YOURSELF and have that be a normal thing. But if I&rsquo;m dealing with someone who I barely know&mdash;random people at work, PTA members, the plumber, etc.&mdash;I am always, by rule, nicer and more courteous than is probably necessary. I do the THANKS! thing because I don&rsquo;t want there to be any doubt about my appreciation for their efforts (no matter how meager), and I don&rsquo;t want there to be any question as to whether or not I&rsquo;m being sarcastic. You never want to give people a reason to think you&rsquo;re a cock, which is why I overcompensate to a hilarious degree. &ldquo;Thanks for sending me that link!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 I also use exclamation points anytime I am sent a picture of something/someone that is cute. Like if you send me a photo of your kid, I will definitely text back &ldquo;SO CUTE!&rdquo; as a courtesy. I&rsquo;m not above the everyday, Facebook-style exchange of mutual adoration.
</p>
<p>
 By the way, I&rsquo;ve had to email my kid&rsquo;s teacher a few times and it&rsquo;s a supremely daunting experience. I can&rsquo;t even imagine how many emails from deranged parents these teachers get, so whenever I have to email a teacher, I&rsquo;m so formal that I basically sound like I&rsquo;m composing a letter to President McKinley. &ldquo;Dear ma&rsquo;am, I am writing to you on the matter of my dearest son, who was found to have been standing on the communal latrine not but five days forthwith.&rdquo; One time I sent the teacher an email with an error in it and I had to write a SECOND email, which pained me. &ldquo;OMG so sorry. A THOUSAND PARDONS. Summon the lash for me as I have committed the most egregious of sins. Please ignore previous email.&rdquo;

 But you&rsquo;re not doing any of that shit. That is why I suggest buying a VR headset. I actually tried one for the first time last weekend at this party where they rented a video game truck (did you know video game trucks exist? Well they do and they are fucking UNREAL) that was outfitted with PlayStations and Wiis and Xboxes and enough cool shit to make all the kids&rsquo; heads explode. They also had VR shit, so I let them strap one on my melon and I got to pretend I was an East London gangster for eight quality minutes. I fogged up the lenses within five seconds, but otherwise it was TOTALLY real. I was right there, hiding behind a desk and fumbling my clip and hitting everything except my intended target. Just like real life, baby.
</p>
<p>
 I give VR four stars. I was just like the old dude in that Samsung Christmas ad: YOU GOTTA TRY THIS! It was legit. When I get old, I&rsquo;m gonna buy one of those headsets and get stoned and put on some cool drone footage and just pretend I&rsquo;m a bird all day long. Tell me there&rsquo;s a flaw in that plan. YOU CANNOT.

 Anyway, buy a virtual flying game. That should do the trick.

 Don&rsquo;t knock it till you try it. Cream cheese is actually pretty tasty on both banana bread and zucchini bread. Makes it taste like carrot cake! The problem is that, in addition to adding untold amounts of calories and fat, cold cream cheese can be a bitch to spread on it. You end up having the slice crumble in your hand, which is a real low moment. The safest, fattest play is to butter that fucker up when it&rsquo;s warm.

 We made one like this from a little kit that costs $20 or so, and it slides along the track on a cushion of reverse magnetic force. It was cool as shit. I must have slid that thing back and forth 900 times before the magnet strips came unglued. Cheap piece of crap.

 I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve even ASKED any place if I can open a running tab. Man, that would be sweet.

Imagine going to just one bar for life and then dropping dead from liver disease in it. COOL.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, I assume permanent bar tabs are a rarity now because A) Most bars are owned by some faceless conglomerate that expressly forbids them, B) Are staffed with so many people that it&rsquo;s hard to keep track of who has a tab and who doesn&rsquo;t and C) You can just settle up with a credit card after a night of drinking anyway, and not worry about getting overcharged for shit on a monthly bill. Who remembers a full month of drinking? I&rsquo;m killing these brain cells for a reason yo.

 The kind of place that still probably offers an open tab would be like Trees Lounge: located in a small town, staffed with like two people, with a grand total of five regular customers. Basically, the kind of joint that makes you want to kill yourself. The only way to run a tab in high style now is if you belong to a country club. Putting everything on the Underhills&rsquo; tab is the way to go.

  I live on the gulf coast of Florida and today we made our first trip of the season to the beach. I stopped at a gas station on the way and picked up a few waters and a can of original Pringles for a beach snack. I was excited because, objectively, beach snacks are next-level good - something about the heat, the salty air, and the Alabama fans chain smoking Marlboro Lights a few chairs down really intensifies the tastiness of otherwise standard snack items. But today I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied. I felt like the Pringle was too bland to mask the rogue grains of sand that inadvertently made it into each bite and the chip itself wasn&rsquo;t thick enough to fill me up without eating the entire tube. In hindsight, I&rsquo;m thinking Cheez-Its would&rsquo;ve been the optimal choice. What&rsquo;s the perfect beach snack?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 If we&rsquo;re talking strictly about shit you pack into your bag before you head to the beach, my answer is Cheetos. Every time we go on a beach vacation, I make a point of stocking up on absolute SHIT, just the junkiest possible food that we don&rsquo;t usually buy at home. That means Cheetos, Oreos, crates full of honey roasted peanuts, etc. Then I hit the beach with a bag of Cheetos and get to work on my finger tan. By the time I&rsquo;m finished, my fingers look like Trump. Then I take a wash in the Atlantic and I&rsquo;m clean as a whistle. I love me some beach Cheetos. You could fill the bag with seawater and I&rsquo;d still eat them. Mmmmmm&hellip;brine Cheetos.
</p>
<p>
 If we&rsquo;re expanding to snack bar items, the obvious answer is hot dogs and ice cream. A hot dog at the beach is even better than a hot dog at the ballpark, and it&rsquo;s cheaper too. I want 87 beach dogs and I want them now.
</p>
<p>
 Oh, and shaved ice! Every time we go to the beach, there&rsquo;s a dude in a buggy selling shaved ice and the kids shit themselves when he drives by. They traverse 50 yards of blazing hot sands just to get a cone of blue raspberry. Then they drop it in the sand and cry and beg for another and then I say no and then they cry even louder and then I say FUCK THIS and we all go home. Great beach day.
