 So Drew asked me to fill in for him on this week's Funbag, because apparently as

 I'm supposed to have oodles of free time to do his job while he goes off and teaches his kids how to cook meth with his neighbor Chad, or whatever the fuck it is parenting entails in Yonkers. (Full disclosure: I'm more of a SO CAL SURF SLACKER than an UPTIGHT EAST COAST WASP, so save your teeth-gnashings, Yonkerites; I'm just gonna ignore them.)
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, I immediately said yes. I mean, this is a discerning audience of at least a hundred people now that the site's current iteration has banished the Funbag to East Mordor, and I figure I should do one more guest post before Nick Denton ends up selling all the writers as sex slaves to fund Kinja 18.39437pi-1 and the opportunity's gone. (I'm a history major, I know how these things work. It's how the Ottoman Empire fell.)
</p>
<p>
 A couple hours later, Drew sent me a bunch of your emails, and told me to answer the ones I found interesting, and that also he usually does around 4,000 words, but I could do whatever I felt comfortable with.
</p>
<p>

 4,000 words?! Let me tell you, when I saw that follow-up missive, the writing gods were truly NOT propitiated. Their tumescent word-members were NOT throbbing in veiny anticipation of run-on sentence followed by run-on sentence, and this humble scribe knows you deserve more. Drew may be content to put in minimal effort for you poor schmucks because he thinks he can skate by on natural talent, but I am a SCRAPPY, HIGH MOTOR, EFFORT writer. We are answering ALL of these emails, because, frankly, I'm adrift in a vast sea of loneliness and failed dreams, and it's either that or knock my wife out on an elevator in Vegas.

  I want a Deadspin I-team exclusive, in-depth, undercover, ground-breaking, gonzo expose into why college teams, even really good ones (I'm looking at you, Saban) have shitty kickers. Anytime these guys are more than 20 yards out, it's totally a game of fuck-up roulette. There really are not enough soccer castoffs out there to make sure Mammoth State U's football team has a reasonable shot at getting at least three points every time they cross the opponent's 35 yard line?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Let me preface this one by saying, yes, this is an actual email Drew sent me, and not my subconscious creating an opportunity to rant and rave about the overwhelming ignorance of college (and professional!) football fandom regarding kicking. Thanks, George!
</p>
<p>
 Want to know why your team has a shitty kicker? Because your team has a shitty coach who doesn't know the first thing about the basic fundamentals of kicking and punting, but figures that a soccer castoff will do just fine so long as he gets screamed at loudly enough.
</p>
<p>
 In my five years of college ball, and eight years in the NFL, I did not have a single special teams coach or head coach who had the faintest idea how it is that I did my job, and that is how it is EVERYWHERE. (I was lucky that early on in high school, I found a couple coaches who did know a thing or two so I could teach myself later). Now a lot of this is due to the fact that people just don't care about kicking, because it's only nine or 10 plays out of the game (whereas the offense and defense GLOREEEEE BOYZ get 35 to 40), but can you imagine if your linebacker coach had no idea how to teach the fundamentals of tackling and assignment responsibility? Or if your quarterbacks coach didn't know what proper throwing mechanics were? [Insert Tebow/Jets joke here.] The fan base for that team would lose its shit, and for good reason, but somehow when it comes to kicking, it's perfectly fine to regard an eminently understandable series of motions as some sort of witchcraft.
</p>
<p>
 The reason for this is because people are fucking lazy, and secretly believe that "BOY GOLLY IF I STEPPED OUT ON THAT FIELD I COULD SHOW THOSE NAMBY-ASS KICKERS JUST HOW EASY IT IS TO MAKE A GULDARNED FIELD GOAL," like some sort of chorus-line action hero. Then they eat another log of Velveeta and yell at the TV when their team loses by two in the Fuddrucker's Futtbucker Bowl Brought to You by Mark Emmert's Lack of Basic Human Conscience.
</p>
<p>
 If you want your team to stop trotting out Shanky McWideleft, then you need to get on the coaching staff's collective asses and force them to actually
 <em>
  learn
 </em>
 the fundamentals of kicking, and not just regard the special teams coordinator as the bottom rung on the ladder toward head coach.
</p>
<p>
 Until then, yeah, good luck with those 35-yarders.

<p>
 Well, Paul, as long as you had access to relatively clean water from the bathroom (make sure no one's pooping, otherwise it'll taste like fast-food coffee), the average human being can survive anywhere from two weeks to the eventual heat death of the universe, according to Yahoo Answers. I'm gonna guess, though, that a steady diet of ketchup and Taco Bell Anal Hemorrhage Sauce would cause acute liver and kidney failure within a week or so, and you'd die curled up near the deep fryer several days later&mdash;so a week and a half to two weeks, depending on if you actually eat the condiments or not.
</p>

 Fun fact: My wife had a roommate in college that got scurvy because all she ate was top ramen for a month, and Top Ramen has AT LEAST 573 percent more nutrients than your average ketchup packet.

 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Matt, I don't know what kind of fast-food places you're frequenting that you have to actually ask for condiments as opposed to grabbing a grubby fistful from the bins lying out on top of the counter, but I would agree that it's perfectly okay to interrupt the person ordering in order to get the Heinz 69 Worschesterereshirhsiere sauce required to hide the taste of tears seasoning your meat "patty." I mean, it's not like the grotesquely overweight Hell's Angel ordering 15 Sphincter Slurries even has food in his hands at the moment, and your needs clearly outweigh his needs according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Pink Goop Accoutrements, so butt right in and treat yo'self. There's only about a 23 percent chance he'll stab you (unless you're in Oakland, in which case you better wait your turn no matter who's ordering).
</p>
<p>
 Also, if you help clear Paul's corpse away from the deep fryer, they'll probably give you a bucketful of whatever condiment you need.

  So when the wife and I are passing a typical Friday night at home with some beverages, we sometimes mix in the shot of whiskey and imagine we are actually out somewhere fun. Our issue is the two-year-old has seen this and now insists on joining in and having her own glass (with water!). She then cheers along with us, slugging it down. Because she is two, some days she also demands to drink from her shot glass just because. We can't decide if this is cute, or if we are creating a future alcoholic who will be on Girls Gone Wild when she's 15. I'd send along the photo evidence that we find endearing, but we're afraid to show people lest Children Services come knocking.

 Kids are just the worst at noticing things you wish they wouldn't notice.

  Johnny Manziel and Jadeveon Clowny have 30+ teams going to these athletes' pro days. Why show up when you don't have a decent chance of drafting them (i.e. the Broncos, the Seahawks). If you wanted to see a player's pro day and you were a team with very little chance of drafting that player or you don't really need that player on your roster, wouldn't you rather watch it on the NFL Network and save that waste of time?
 </p>

<p>
 Here's the thing, Matt. (You don't mind if I call you Matt, right?) The NFL Draft is the biggest clusterfuck to ever clusterfuck (surpassing even
 <em>
  Debbie Does Dallas V: The Vagining
 </em>
 ). No one ever knows what's going to happen. You have scouts and GMs and coaches who think they can identify what they're looking for in a player, but secretly, deep down, they know it's the world's biggest crapshoot, and they're terrified of looking like fools. They concoct these ridiculous Draft Day scenarios ("What if other teams pass on Manziel due to recently published cowhumping selfies, and we get a shot at him?!") to cover their own asses in case something
 <em>
  does
 </em>
 happen, and they have to decide whether or not to take Jadeveon Clowney after he loses a leg in a thresher accident. ("We saw him work out personally, and even with one leg he's got a thirst for the game! JUST STRAP MJD TO THE STUMP AND HE'LL BE FINE.") Then they talk themselves into thinking that MJ Clowney is a good idea, or that it'll confuse the other teams, and the next thing you know, JaMarcus Russell is your quarterback.
</p>
<p>
 Four years down the line, when it's patently obvious that Pirate Jadeveon just isn't working out (primarily because MJD left to pursue a more lucrative career in fantasy football), and they have to justify it to the owner, they'll point out that time they saw Jadeveon work out "personally," and that the "intangibles" were there, but he never fully materialized as a player due to circumstances "out of their control." Cover-your-ass office politics are just as much a part of the NFL as anyplace else, and I'd argue they're probably even more prevalent due to the sheer amount of money involved. No one wants to take the fall because
 <em>
  their
 </em>
 draft choice didn't pan out, which is why you see high-drafted guys get chance after chance even when it's clear they can't play, and you see the same merry-go-round of idiot coaches and GMs fuck things up at stop after stop.
</p>
<p>
 The other reason all those guys show up is because after the workout, they all get to go out and get blasted on the company dime, and really, who doesn't enjoy that?

 I'd say, look at it this way. Being a man means being efficient with your time. Having to dry off the annoying spots of wetness on your fingers each time you take a drink by reaching down to your napkin is ultimately costing you around 15 seconds of your life per drink (because science). Over the course of a typical evening party, say four beers long, that's an entire minute that could've been spent scratching your crotch, or eyeballing your wife's hot work friend when you think your wife isn't looking because she's talking to Gary in Accounting (who's secretly checking out your wife's ass when she turns around).

The fifth, old-timey photo is of what looks to be the original hipster from 1820, wearing an expression that makes me want to punch him right in the face, and now it's all I can picture when I think of "Native American facial hair," so once again, everything interesting about the indigenous population of this country has been completely ruined by white people.

 Theoretically, I guess there's really no upper limit to how long you could go with a single washcloth.

<p>
 Practically though, it depends on how comfortable you are washing in the accumulated filth from previous days. I, personally, don't use a washcloth, because it seems like a really nice incubator for all sorts of disgusting bacteria, but I would imagine three to five days is probably the accepted length of time. If the washcloth starts walking out of the shower on its own after you're done, though, you've probably gone a little too long.

I can see my somewhat blurred head appearing in Facebook posts in Kazakhstan, family albums in Taiwan or even glossy photos pinned to those fuzzy cubicle walls in Paraguay (do they use cubicles there?). I can't fully explain why, but this realization has shaken me to my core. Should I feel violated or honored that my image has (potentially) traversed the globe?

<p>
 Generally, when most people take pictures, they really only care about the object in the center of the frame, unless it's something amazingly distracting in the background (like a really good photobomb or an accidental nipple). The other thing about photos is that 99 percent of the people who look at them will look at them once and then banish them forever from their minds. They have lots of other stuff they have to try and remember, and some tall dude's head in the blurred background is way less important than finding potable drinking water, or not getting shot for having the wrong last name. I think you can be fairly safe in assuming that you haven't been violated, and that Paraguayan llama farmers have much more pressing matters on their hands.

  If the receivers are covered and a quarterback is outside of the pocket, he can throw the ball back to the line of scrimmage without incurring an intentional grounding penalty. My question is: Why don't running backs ever do the same thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  Every week, I see a broken run play which leads to a running back stepping out of bounds six yards behind the line of scrimmage. If this back is outside of the tackle box, couldn't he save those yards by tossing a pass out of bounds (assuming the pass got back to the line of scrimmage). Is there are rule that prevents a runner from throwing the ball away?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Most running backs are "me first" GLOREEEE BOYZ who need the ball at every possible opportunity in order to showcase their skills, and the thought of voluntarily giving it up is anathema to them. They literally cannot consider the possibility, so from a mental standpoint, that's why you never see it happen.
</p>
<p>
 From an actual rules standpoint, running plays are designed to release interior linemen downfield to block players on the second and third levels, and if you throw the ball with an ineligible receiver (like an interior lineman) downfield it's a penalty, so it really doesn't make much sense to possibly turn the ball over to the other team when you're not going to get anything out of throwing the ball anyway. At least, that's how I would explain it to a GLOREEEE BOY running back if I were a coach.

  I'm getting married in a few months, and lately I keep having dreams where I'm having sex with a girl that's not my future wife. I never had these dreams until recently, and now they're happening at least twice a week. The girl is usually someone different from dream to dream. Sometimes it'll be one of my exes, and other times someone I don't recognize. In my dream, I'm always fully aware that I'm cheating on my fiancee, and I always feel guilty. I don't read into dreams, so I'm not worried about actually cheating, and I don't feel guilty in real life. I'm just wondering if this is unique, or if you and the readers have had recurring dreams like this leading up to a wedding as well?

 This is a perfectly natural dream to have leading up to a wedding, because it's your subconscious telling you, "Hey man, you're gonna be stuck with just this girl for the rest of your life, are you sure you wanna do that? Look at all these other options you could be humping, spreading that genetic code everywhere. SUBMIT TO THE NATURAL IMPERATIVES OF 200,000 YEARS OF EVOLUTION OR I'LL MAKE YOU SHIT YOURSELF ON THE SUBWAY."
</p>
<p>
 Thankfully, most of us have learned how to ignore our primal subconscious, so as long as you're not going around willy-nilly poking everything that moves while awake, I think you should be okay. Just try to make it to the wedding without stressing out too much and/or catching a venereal disease from a stripper named Candi at your bachelor party. Wives hate that.

 Definitely mouth. You can drink some milk or something to ease the burn, especially if you're out in public, but there's no way to moderate the fiery anguish of a three-alarm salsa after it's passed through your colon other than waiting it out.

 Fun fact: The cells in your mouth and your ass are essentially the same thing, which is why it feels so similar coming and going.

   So say an NFL team was able to figure out a single running play that went for exactly 3.34 yards on every carry. That is, they always ran the same play and it always resulted in a first down on three attempts and, therefore, they scored on every possession. Obviously this team would go undefeated so long as they could stop an opposing offense once. My question is twofold. First, after the first season, do you think the NFL would make the play illegal simply because it worked so well? Second, do you think the team would get more fans for going undefeated or less because the games would be so boring to watch?

 First off, there's a couple flaws in your assumption that they would automatically win every time as long as their defense stopped the other team once. You have to take into account turnovers on kickoffs (which I assume they would mitigate by simply downing the ball as soon as they got it), and more importantly, the fact every team would onside kick every time once they figured out what was happening. This is ultimately what would get the play banned, because onside kicks are pretty dangerous for those involved in them, and to have multiple onside kicks in a game would send Goodell into a frothing rage.
</p>
<p>
 Secondly, you're also assuming none of the players involved in said play ever get injured over the course of the season, which is highly unlikely to happen. Plays that work great with one set of personnel tend to fail miserably with a different set, so you're also banking on eleven superhuman athletes in order to get that undefeated season, or an entire team of Adrian Petersons who can all fill in interchangeably, at which point it doesn't matter what plays you run.
</p>
<p>
 For the sake of arguing hypotheticals, however, let's assume that this team does go undefeated running the same boring play game after game. I think they get more fans, because everyone loves a winner, and those that hate what they're doing will tune in every week in the hopes that this is the game they finally lose.
</p>
<p>
 Case in point: the Yankees. There's Yankee fans that have never been to New York, and there's Yankee haters who don't know the first thing about baseball. They just know it's a franchise that consistently buys its way to victory, and for some people that's awesome, and for others it makes them bloodvomit. They all watch regardless.

  One morning, you wake up with the ability to float 12 inches above the ground, no higher. You can hover around, but only as fast as you could normally walk, and floating takes the same amount of physical exertion as walking. Your ability does not work over water deeper than 3 inches. What is the most lucrative career you could pursue with this ability? Could you parlay it into billions somehow, or would you end up relegated to a Vegas show?
 </p>

<p>
 Here's exactly how that scenario plays out. You discover you have this ability, show it to some friends and family, maybe put it up on YouTube where it goes slightly viral. The NSA catches wind, blackbags your sleeping form one night, and then they vivisect you to isolate whatever it was that gave you your power so they can implement it into U.S. soldiers to make them immune to land mines, as well as save money on carpet-cleaning bills. Sadly, you do not survive this process, you do not make billions, you do not even get the all-you-can-eat steak breakfast buffet in Vegas. Your best bet is to never show anyone you have this power, because there will be someone in BIG GUBMINT somewhere that wants to exploit you, and they will not care in the slightest if it ruins your life.

  Yesterday evening I take my son out (he's two), just us. We go to an amusement park. As we get there, another single dad is with a son roughly the same age. His boy is wearing an Arsenal jersey, and I'm an Arsenal fan, so I compliment the jersey as we are all walking towards the front gate. It's a long walk and we start talking about that day's game, about where we each watched it, which leads to finding out what we do for a living, him telling me he's got friends in North London, about how he became a soccer fan (it's a LONG walk...). We get to the security point and go through lines next to each other, we're still talking, it's been five or so minutes at this point, and then, right as we pass through security (with still a good walk to go to the front gate), his son just loses it. One of those random drop-the-ground-and-throw-a-fit-for-no-reason kinda things. We're within sight of amusement park fun. Guy keeps talking to me even as his kid is rolling around on the ground, but I can't really just stop and wait out a tantrum with him, right? So the guy keeps talking and after like a brief stutter-step hesitation I just look at his son and say, "Good luck, have a good night."
 </p>
 <p>
  This guy and I had hit it off. Am I an idiot for not making a bigger effort to make a friend? Am I an asshole for abandoning him mid-conversation? I'm the asshole, right?
