  I'm a recent college graduate who followed a job opportunity
to a town where I know no one. While the adjustment from college to adult life
sucks (less drinking on weekday nights, skipping classes), it was expected.
What wasn't expected: how hard it is to make adult friends. I love my job and
have a couple of people I know from work, but I'd like to meet some non-work
people. Any advice?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It's nearly impossible to make friends with other adults for
a lot of different reasons, time being one of the biggest.  You're an adult.  You have a job.  You have responsibilities.  Maybe you have a girlfriend or spouse.  That leaves less time for you to develop the
kind of lasting, lifelong bonds with friends that happens in high school and
college.  High school and college kids
have SHITLOADS of time to sit in each other's rooms and drink and discover that
OMG YOU ALSO HAD A DOG NAMED SKIPPY WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG SOUL MATES!  There's less time for that now.  You need to know where this friendship is
going right away.  If we're not gonna end
up snorting coke together and watching the first forty minutes of
 <em>
  Full Metal Jacket
 </em>
 over and over again,
don't waste my time!
</p>
<p>
 And there's more awkwardness.  No grownup wants to ADMIT that they need a
friend because that seems desperate.  You
worry that other people will wonder why, exactly, you still need a friend.  Were you in prison?  Did everyone at college catch you
masturbating?  What did you do to end up
so alone?  LOSER.
</p>
<p>
 I've had that kind of anxiety.  A few months ago, my wife was like, "You
should hang with Kelly's husband.  Maybe
watch a football game together!" 
And I was URRR DURRR GOD THAT WOULD BE WEIRD, even though I liked the
guy and happily would have had beers with him. 
Men are reluctant to admit being lonely, or nervous, and they hate
putting themselves in any kind of vulnerable spot.  What if your man date goes wrong?  How fucking stupid will you feel if you can't
even get a date that involves no sex right? 
On a certain level, you feel as if you and your new "friend"
are just kidding yourselves... that you're trying to force yourself into BFF
status when you have none of the shared memories or wacky camp stories of a
pair of childhood buddies.
</p>
<p>
 I moved down to the DC area with my wife ten years ago and
didn't really know anyone here.  Then I
met another guy online (
 <a href="https://twitter.com/Unsilent" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  KOGOD
 </a>
 !) and
we met up at a bar once, and it was basically like going on a blind date.  I think I got drunk BEFORE I met up with him,
just to ease my nerves.  We're good friends
now, but we'll both readily admit that heading to a bar to meet your new
CYBERBUDDY is a hard thing for grown men to do, even in a day and age where
meeting people online is no longer stigmatized (I would argue that online
dating is far more acceptable now than online friend-seeking&mdash;I've never seen
an ad for any kind of platonic eHarmony). 
I Gchatted KOGOD about this yesterday and he said, "i still feel
awkward around you."  So there you
go.  SO SO AWKWARD.
</p>
<p>
 If you're living somewhere new and you're trying to meet new
friends, the important thing is to get over the shyness hump and OWN your
loneliness.  No sense in trying to make
yourself seem cooler than you are.  No
sense in trying to convince potential new friends that you have other awesome
buddies nearby.  No sense in avoiding
people when you know you NEED them.  If
you're honest with yourself and you say to your co-workers or friends of
co-workers that you meet at happy hour, "Man, I don't know anyone in this
city.  I'm down with beers any time you
feel like grabbing them," the world will probably start opening up for
you.
</p>
<p>
 Organized activities also help.  There's a reason transplants living in DC
join dipshit kickball leagues, and it ain't because they like kickball.  You have to get out.  You have to be places.  You have to give yourself opportunities to
find people who like you and accept you and don't give a shit that you don't
have your own personal JackO or J-Bug in tow.  There are plenty of people like that out
there&mdash;be it online or at your local bar's trivia night.  You just have to be brave enough to find
them.

  Why haven't Goodell and the team owners tried to push

that happening? Every other element of the NFL has a corporate logo pasted on

<p>
 I assume because Nike pays the NFL handsomely to keep those
jerseys free of additional clutter.  In
fact, Nike's recent licensing agreement with the NFL is worth a
 <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2011/03/nikes-nfl-apparel-deal-valued-at-11b.html?page=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  staggering
$1.1 billion
 </a>
 , and the next contract will only be more lucrative.  I assume there's language in that contract
that says the NFL can't sell jersey space to other advertisers, since an NFL
jersey is essentially a joint advertisement for both the NFL and for Nike.  You see the jersey, you like it, you buy it,
and the NFL and Nike both profit handsomely from the arrangement.  It's probably not worth jeopardizing that
gravy train just to squeeze in a shoulder patch for Doritos.
</p>
<p>
 Then again, soccer jerseys still sell briskly even with big
name advertisers&mdash;Emirates airlines, AIG, etc.&mdash;festooning them.  There may come a time when Goodell sits down
with Nike and is like, "You know what? 
You're gonna give us more money for the next contract, AND you're let us
put whatever the fuck we want on our jerseys. 
TRY AND STOP US MWAHAHAHAHAHA (shows Nike where all the bodies are
buried)."  It wouldn't surprise me,
because fans and sportswriters would spend all of six seconds being outraged ("I
can't believe they sullied their brand with another brand!") before
becoming accustomed to it.

<blockquote>
 <p>
  I'm a big believer in the idea that you can tell how good a
show is going to be by the opening credits. At the risk of hijacking the
comment section, please rank the top 10 opening sequences in the last 30 years.
Conversely, name the five worst on actually good shows. I'll get you started.
Good shows in no particular order (drama category only):
  <em>
   Sopranos, Mad Men, Miami Vice, Walking Dead, CSI, Game of Thrones,
X-Files, Six Feet Under, Dukes of Hazzard, True Blood
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The Wire
  </em>
  has the
single greatest discrepancy between great show and terrible open. Season 2 excluded.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I agree with you about
 <em>
  The
Wire
 </em>
 , mostly because I hated the theme song, and because the title sequence
always looked like it cost three dollars to produce.  But that's an anomaly.  In general, I think most people grow to love
the title sequence of a show because they love the show itself.  Now, that's not always true.  I used to watch
 <em>
  House
 </em>
 a lot and didn't give two shits about the title
sequence.
</p>
<p>
 But in the pre-DVR days, I would damn near run over a Girl
Scout parade to get home in time to see Tony Soprano drive through the Lincoln
Tunnel.  I had to see that, even though
I'd seen many times before.  REALLY SET
THE TONE, YOU GUYS.  The best title
sequences (in drama, at least) give you the feeling that some serious shit is
about to go down.  You will usually find
that the best shows also take a lot of great care in their title sequences,
unlike some shit show that licenses a pop song and then slaps the actors' faces
on the screen. A title sequence can also drive you away.  The reason I never watched
 <em>
  M*A*S*H
 </em>
 as a kid was because the title
music made me want to kill myself (It's even called "Suicide is Painless").
</p>
<p>
 I'll go ahead and rank my favorite ten openings ever, comedy
or drama.  They'll be missing lots of
shows, since I haven't seen everything. 
My ten would be:
</p>
<p>
 1.
 <em>
  The
Simpsons
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 2.
 <em>
  The
Sopranos
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 3.
 <em>
  Cheers
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 4.
 <em>
  Monty
Python's Flying Circus
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 5.
 <em>
  Saturday
Night Live
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 6.
 <em>
  Mad
Men
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 7.
 <em>
  NYPD
Blue
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 8.
 <em>
  The
Muppet Show
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 9.
 <em>
  Get
Smart
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 10.
 <em>
  Louie
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 10a.
 <em>
  Growing Pains
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 I really liked the
 <em>
  Growing Pains
 </em>
 theme song when
I was a kid.  I think I still do.  I'm not made of stone.  As for the best shows with the lamest title
sequences, my list is
 <em>
  The Wire
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  The Office (UK version)
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  Absolutely Fabulous
 </em>
 , and
 <em>
  South Park
 </em>
 .  I love
 <em>
  South
Park
 </em>
 and I've always been cool with Primus, but I hate that song.

  One time at a family function, my uncle started talking
about smoking pot and drinking when he was younger and he asked me, "You
smoked some weed back then right?" I'm 28 so you would think I am old
enough to be honest with my mom, but I pussied out and said "Oh no! I only
tried it once!" I was nervous that my mom would never look at me the same
because I lied to her for years about smoking and drinking. At what point (if
ever) is it acceptable to admit to your parents that you tried drugs or partied
in high school and college?

 I think once you're out of the house and gainfully employed
and no longer beholden to your folks for, like, money, you're in the clear.  That means roughly by age 46.  I'm 37 and even though I've written about

 plenty, I never ever ever talk about it with my folks.  I still fear their disapproval.  I know they can't DO anything about it.  I know I'm my own man.  But God forbid I bring it up and then my mom
is like, "Ohhhh, DREW...."  I
would shrink and die.  I'll never purge
the shy WASPiness from my system completely.

 <p>
  Have you ever seen (with your own eyes, not on Google
images) a baby pigeon? My friends and I talk about this almost every day
(because we lead pathetic, sad lives). Where are they? I see baby birds all
over the place, but never baby pigeons, just full-grown ones. Do they nest on
tall buildings, and just never come down until they're....pigeon-esque? Or do
they live in the suburbs and commute to the city? I once witnessed a pigeon
transfer from one train to another (
  <a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/19ciyb43l5totjpg/ku-medium.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

suburbs of Chicago, so I can only assume this is the case.

Science
 </a>
 dealt with this a while back. 
Apparently, baby pigeons are kept in their nests until they're a month
old.  At that point, they're fully grown
and ready to fly out into the big city and shit all over your windshield.  If you let a baby pigeon out of the nest
before then, I assume that it flies to LA and begins working in the bird porn
industry.  WIN BIG MAMA'S FALLEN ANGEL...
</p>
<p>
 So that's why you will likely never see a baby pigeon out in
the wild.  You're just gonna have to
scale the side of an abandoned warehouse and poke at a nest with a slim
jim.  Good luck to you!

  How much money would it take for you to ride in a motorcycle
sidecar for an entire year, rain or shine? And not one of those new fancy
models from BIG SIDECAR either. I'm talking straight up Indiana Jones-style. This
includes your daily commute, recreational jaunts, errands, etc. and at least
one long-distance road trip. Let's assume that you would never have to wait on
your driver, he is always ready at a moment's notice.
 </p>

<p>
 Does my chronic back pain factor into this?  Because those things look like murder on my
lumbar region.  My life is now all about
avoiding uncomfortable chairs.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, if that's NOT a factor, and if I can drink the
entire time and wear those old tymey sidecar goggles while riding shotgun, then
I'm happily accepting that arrangement for a tidy $5,000.  Having a driver at my beck and call would be
pretty sweet.  In my daydreams, when I
have a billion dollars, the driver is the second member of the entourage hired
(first is the butler&mdash;those crepe suzettes don't make themselves).  Having a driver on call is such a fantastic
luxury that people will hire an Uber car without even knowing how much it will
cost them, which is completely fucking stupid. 
Being driven around is awesome, even if it means getting the occasional
piece of stray gravel to the face.

 <p>
  What percentage of extra points do you think you could make
if you became an NFL team's extra point specialist? Let's say you get to go
through all the OTAs with said team and training camp so you have a coaching
and practice. I actually think a person could get to 75 percent.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I doubt you could get up that high.  There's still a level of physical talent you
need to do that job, not to mention the fact that you'll be kicking every road extra
point in front of a crowd that KNOWS you're a fraud.  I'd shit my pants if I had to do that.  A year of training isn't enough.  I'd blow the first couple of real game
attempts and then be reduced to a quivering wreck.  I say fifty percent would be my ceiling, and
that's probably giving myself too much credit. 
I know that even college kickers have an easy time with the extra point,
but they're still way more athletic than I am. 
If you're a natural athlete, that's one thing.  But if you're the kind of poor bastard that
can bust his ass year round only to have his forty time be EXACTLY the same as
it was last fall and GOD DAMMIT WHY DID GOD CURSE ME WITH THESE SHODDY GENES,
it's a different story.  I have issues.
</p>
<p>
 The reason PATs look easy is strictly because kickers MAKE
it look easy.  They train year round and
they do stretches that hurt to look at. 
They have the kind of automatic muscle memory of a golfer or a baseball
slugger that takes years to hone.  I
should probably appreciate their craft more than I do.  Then again, GET OFF THE FUCKING FIELD IDIOT
KICKER LEAVE THE GAME TO THE REAL ATHLETES.

  I finally got the missus pregnant after a few months of
trying, and we are pumped.  This is our first kid, and we are still in
that, "We can't tell family yet, because it is too early" stage,
which is fine by me.  When does that fear subside, if ever, that my wife won't
actually carry the baby full term and something horrible will happen? I
constantly ask how she is feeling, and every time she goes into the bathroom, I
am terrified she will come out and say the dreaded "M" word.

<p>
 You can rest easy after the first three months.  Most miscarriages occur within the first
trimester.  In fact,
 <a href="http://www.babymed.com/miscarriage/first-trimester-miscarriage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  this site
 </a>
 says that one in three or four of ALL pregnancies end in a first trimester
miscarriage, which is terrifying.  Once
you clear three months, you have much better odds of bringing the baby to full
term.  But it's your first kid, so you'll
probably still freak out anyway.  You'll
freak out about miscarriages.  You'll
freak out about labor complications. 
You'll freak out about SIDS and autism. 
You'll freak out about everything. 
And then you'll have one or two more kids and you'll cease giving a
shit.  With the third kid, I think we
told the plumber sometime within the first five weeks.  Then we let him name the kid.

 As far as the history of mankind goes, Hitler is kind of
late to the party.  I assume we're trying
to figure out what one person has been heard of by the greatest number of

someone from a few centuries earlier.  I

<blockquote>
 <p>
  My roommates and I have recently engaged in minor squabbles
regarding the temperature of the house as winter begins to take hold. One
roommate contends that 65 is an acceptable indoor temperature because, as he
puts it, "If you were out for a run in 65 degrees, you would be in shorts
and a t shirt." I find this ridiculous because the whole point of not
being homeless would seem to be the privilege of sitting around naked in your
own dwelling. 65 degrees is not conducive to sedentary nudity, especially when
it's fucking freezing outside and the house is drafty. I feel like 70 degrees
is a fair compromise and anyone who thinks that 65 is an acceptable thermostat
temperature throughout the winter is a communist.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well now, wait a moment. 
You have roommates, so no one needs you sitting around naked on the
sofa, legs akimbo, feeding yourself grapes all day.  That's uncouth.  I can only speak from personal experience
when I say sixty-eight usually does the trick*. 
Any higher and your taint starts to sweat.  Any lower and you start shivering like an
elderly pneumonia patient.  Sixty-eight
works just fine.
</p>
<p>
 I went to my folks' house for Christmas and they have the
thermostat set much lower than that because my dad is the kind of old-school
dad that would like his gas bill to be in the single digits.  "WHAT AM I, THE POWER COMPANY?!"  Anyway, that house was cold as shit, and when
we got home my wife was like, "Maybe we keep our house too warm!"  Fuck that. 
Sixty-eight or bust, lady.

<p>
 Actually, I think you're okay with any amount of time.  If you're quick, the nurses will probably
appreciate it.  If you take too long, the
nurses will probably be sympathetic because you're a grown man trying to get an
erection in a doctor's office.  That's
not easy!  I bet sperm bank nurses have

 Email of the week!
</p>
<p>
 Matt:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  I was using the facilities at work this morning, and as a
guy took his seat in the adjacent stall, some change fell out of his pocket. I
could see 85 cents (three quarters and a dime), and it all stayed on his side
of the line. He let out a "goddamnit," which was followed by brief
period of complete silence and stillness. I assume that he was contemplating
whether or not to pick up his change. He did.
 </p>
 <p>
  My question is what goes through your mind during that time,
and how do the following factors affect your thought process and final
decision? 1) the number and type of coins, 2) the location of the public
restroom, and 3) being alone vs. having somebody in the next stall.
 </p>
 <p>
  I realize that coins that have been in circulation for
longer than five minutes are already disgusting, but no reasonable person is
picking up the change unless it includes at least one quarter, right? I
think the biggest factor would be having somebody in the next stall. In that
scenario, you know you are being judged, plus, you are kind of on the clock. Do
you want to be the guy who picked up less than $1 off the bathroom floor? What
if Bill from accounting recognizes my shoes and knows it's me? If somebody is
next door, I think I would A) leave the change on the floor or B) wait until
they leave if I'm going to pick it up. If you did pick up the change, would you
wash it while washing your hands or just put it in your pocket and continue the
cycle of disgustingness?
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, what if a two of his quarters had rolled to my side of
the line? Am I obligated to kick them back his way or, worse yet, speak to him?
What if he tried to reach over to grab them? Self defense laws go into effect,
right?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I would pick up my own change, with the quarter first
because of coin triage laws.  And if a
rogue quarter rolled my way, I would probably slide them back under with my
foot.  No way you steal a man's poop
quarter.
