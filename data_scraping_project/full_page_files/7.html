 I was tired and sore the other day so I took a bath for the first time in, like, 20 years. It was a bad idea. There&rsquo;s no way for a man my age to sit down in a bathtub without pulling eight different muscle groups. Once I finally lowered myself down, I didn&rsquo;t fit in it at all. I had to do a kind of body part triage, because there was no way to submerge my entire body unless I wanted to turn sideways and go fetal like I was in some really bad Tool video. When I sat up, my torso was freezing, so I slid down and put my heels up against the wall. I looked like I was about to give birth. If anyone had walked in on me, they would have been scarred for life. A bathtub is just a failed hot tub. Never again.

<p>
 Bullshit. Those are the SOUNDS OF THE GAME. They put mics by the floor specifically so you can hear the shoes squeaking and farting. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re really there! I can never get enough of ambient sport sounds, even if they&rsquo;re things that would hugely irritate me in normal life (like my kid bouncing a basketball in the kitchen, which is grounds for filicide). All those squeaks and bounces and thuds get grafted right onto your cortex, so that one day you&rsquo;ll bust out a typewriter and start writing, &ldquo;I remember&hellip; the shoes.&rdquo; Then you will drink some brandy and sniff your own farts and congratulate yourself for your attention to nostalgic detail.

 Frankly, I wouldn&rsquo;t complain if they started using Foley artists to incorporate more noises into the game. Someone gets tackled and you hear a SPLAT. That would be fun.

You teach them not to litter, and to recycle properly, and all that. We usually tell the kids, &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t do that. That&rsquo;s bad for the Earth,&rdquo; and then they stop trying to feed Starburst wrappers to birds.
</p>
<p>
 None of this is new, by the way. They taught us about global warming back when I was in middle school. We had a whole big assembly and the vice principal told us we needed to read

   50 Simple Things You Can Do To Save The Earth
  </em>
 </a>
 . I think I spent a solid week cutting up six-pack rings to save the birds before going back to throwing them out uncut again. It&rsquo;s a hard thing for a kid (or an adult, really) to comprehend that the world is a fragile place when it&rsquo;s so goddamn huge, and so very solid. Stomp the ground right now. That&rsquo;s is some solid fucking ground. Hard to believe it&rsquo;s going anywhere.
</p>
<p>
 But 21st-century kids pick those lessons up pretty quick. Sometimes my kids will spot a plastic bag floating down a creek and they&rsquo;ll do the full

 </a>
 face. It&rsquo;s a nice moment to witness when you&rsquo;re a parent, until you get home and realize they&rsquo;ve been stuffing trash between the couch cushions because they&rsquo;re too lazy to get up and throw shit away. For them, I still treat global warming as a problem that can be solved. I&rsquo;ve told them about rising sea levels and melting ice caps, and I told them that they can help prevent all that by recycling Twinkie boxes. You and I know this isn&rsquo;t true, but it&rsquo;s still worth spinning all this in a positive light to a child, because A) Maybe they&rsquo;ll be inspired to come up with new and important ways to be energy efficient and B) Being mindful of waste is, at this point, just a common courtesy. Even if they could litter, they shouldn&rsquo;t, because that&rsquo;s asshole behavior.
</p>
<p>
 In general, kids are a lot more thoughtful about things like death and the end of the world than adults are. I&rsquo;m old enough now to know that I NEVER EVER EVER want to think about any of that shit, and I usually have enough alcohol and/or paperwork to keep me busy so that I don&rsquo;t have to.  But kids happily luxuriate in death talk. They wanna hear all about it, to the point where I have to be like, &ldquo;Hey man, you&rsquo;re bringing me down with this,&rdquo; and then I distract them with candy. But now is really the age where you should level with them and tell them the truth about what&rsquo;s going on, because now is when they&rsquo;re most open to it. They&rsquo;re not gonna give a shit about any of that by the time they&rsquo;re old enough to date and score a fake ID.  You don&rsquo;t have to be all goth about it, either. You can still spin the news in a positive way, so that they feel compelled to take action instead of sit around in despair.

  I want a new version of basketball in which points can only be scored by either long 3s or dunks. No one denies this is the best part of basketball, so no more mid-range 2s, teams would only be composed of small shooters and big men duking it out in the paint. I see no problem with my newly created Dunkball.

</blockquote>
<p>
 Yeah, but the midrange 2s are what make those dunks and three-pointers possible. If you took them away, the spacing would be all fucked up and no one would have room to make cool threes or throw down a nasty fucking tomahawk jam on Rudy Gobert&rsquo;s head.

 I know I indulge in a LOT of hypothetical rule changes here. But in real life, you&rsquo;re better off not fucking with sports. That new intentional walk rule they just implemented?

 Look at the NBA, where team scoring has increased by 14 points PER GAME since 1999. That&rsquo;s mostly because they put in some new hand checking rules, enforced them, and the game naturally evolved from there. When they got too extreme and moved in the three-point line, it failed and they had to move it back.  The on-court product is pretty entertaining now. There&rsquo;s a natural ebb and flow to sports history, and it&rsquo;s usually better to ride with it and see if players and coaches can figure out, on their own, how to play it as effectively and entertainingly as possible. When you fuck with it too much, you end up like the NFL, where no one knows what the fuck is going on.

  I was in the waiting room at my dentist last week and was really into an article in a magazine. They called me before I finished the article and I was going to steal the magazine. I checked the date and realized it was only one week old. Had it been a few more weeks, I would have taken it. My question: at what point is it okay to steal magazines from waiting rooms? Two weeks? Three weeks? A month?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I have stolen magazines from waiting rooms, but I don&rsquo;t advise it. If you look at the address in the subscription bar and it really belongs to the practice, you should probably put it back, because then everyone will feel free to steal them, and you&rsquo;ll be left with nothing but issues of
 <em>
  National Geographic
 </em>
 to peruse the next time you go to get your toenails bleached. One day, I will answer to God for those back issues of
 <em>
  Newsweek
 </em>
 I lifted from Dr. Burger&rsquo;s office. He will be most displeased.
</p>
<p>
 That said, if someone ELSE left a magazine somewhere for you to enjoy (like they do at the gym), then you can take it. That shit is free, imho. There are people at the gym who are so reliable about leaving magazines around that I actually get indignant when a new issue doesn&rsquo;t turn up in the bin on schedule. &ldquo;Where is this month&rsquo;s

 <p>
  This is a question I have been asking for years: Are there any direct comedy sequels that are funnier than the original movie? A lot of my friends try to argue that
  <em>
   Christmas Vacation
  </em>
  is funnier than the original
  <em>
   Vacation,
  </em>
  but that&rsquo;s not a direct sequel as it follows the very mediocre
  <em>
   European Vacation.
  </em>
  I&rsquo;m talking a straight up sequel like
  <em>
   Ghostbusters 2, Anchorman 2
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Zoolander 2.
  </em>
  My answer is no.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard because great comedies usually take you by surprise, and it&rsquo;s damn near impossible for a sequel to recreate that kind of surprise, especially when they can just rehash the same characters and jokes and still make a goddamn fortune.
</p>
<p>
 However, there are some exceptions. Virtually every
 <em>
  Pink Panther
 </em>
 sequel is better than the first film, which is endless and barely features Peter Sellers at all. In fact, the whole thing became a franchise specifically because people watched the first one and said, &ldquo;This blows, but Peter Sellers is funny!&rdquo;, so they had all the sequels feature Sellers making horribly dated jokes about Asians. VAST IMPROVEMENT.
</p>
<p>
 The other notable example is probably the
 <em>
  Toy Story
 </em>
 movies. I think I still like the first one the best, but a lot of people like
 <em>
  2
 </em>
 and
 <em>
  3
 </em>
 better, apparently because they like crying until all the fluid has been drained from their bodies. God, that Sarah McLachlan song. Throw me in a frozen river, why don&rsquo;t you?
</p>
<p>
 One last thing: there is a very small category of sequels that are comedies even though the original movie was NOT.
 <em>
  Star Trek IV
 </em>
 is a comedy, and a pretty good one. &ldquo;Nuclear wessels&rdquo;! LOL. Never gets old.

  My wife and I play a game every time we end up shopping at a new grocery store. The idea is to guess which corner of the store the bakery is in. Basically every decent sized grocery store has that little corner filled with bread and cupcakes and breadsticks and cookies and other delicious things. If one of us guesses correctly which corner it&rsquo;s in, we get to buy any one baked good for the hell of it as a treat. Anyway we have probably done this upwards of 40 times and I have NOT ONCE guessed correctly. She has at least 20 times. How is this possible? I want my damn six-pack of cupcakes.

  Can you really just shove a handgun into the back of your pants, and walk around like nothing&rsquo;s going on back there, the way they do in movies/TV all the time.

<p>
 Well, you CAN shove it back there if you feel like it. This is Trump&rsquo;s America, and if you want to shoot your buttcheeks off, BIG GUBMINT isn&rsquo;t gonna stop you. Also, the safety on a gun usually takes some effort to click off, as it should. It wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a safety if you could switch to FIRE just by breathing on it.
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m being presumptuous here, but I don&rsquo;t think any self-respecting gun owner walks around with a gun in the back of their pants. That&rsquo;s jayvee shit, and it&rsquo;s a likely sign to other gun owners that you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s like shooting with your hand sideways. You may see it a lot in the movies, but in real life it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that makes everyone else roll their eyes. Real men use a holster when they&rsquo;re going to shoot up a picnic.

 Yeah! What the fuck, man? I&rsquo;ve had that moment where I can&rsquo;t sleep, so I turn the TV on, and there&rsquo;s that little pause between turning it on and the picture appearing where I KNOW that my eyes are about to get murdered. That little pause is the WORST. They need some kind of Late Night button where you push it and the picture slowly fades in over the course of five minutes so that your poor eyes can adjust. Let&rsquo;s patent it. We&rsquo;ll be thousandaires for sure.

 Also, while your iPhone does have a lovely swipe-up menu so you can instantly adjust the brightness (which could stand to have an even less bright setting; I want that screen darker than a confession booth), the powerup screen is blank fucking white.

  If someone asked you to make them a peanut butter sandwich and you couldn&rsquo;t ask any follow-up questions AND you genuinely wanted to give them what they want, would you put jelly on that sandwich?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 NO. A peanut butter sandwich is clearly its own thing and I would only put jelly on it if someone specifically asked for a PB&amp;J. This is especially important when serving children food, because if one goddamn thing about the sandwich is different from what they asked, they react like they just had their hands chopped off. So annoying. If you want a peanut butter sandwich because you enjoy the sensation of nearly dying of thirst before getting your hands on a glass of milk, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m giving you.
</p>
<p>
 Also, I wouldn&rsquo;t know WHICH jelly to use, and people are picky about that sort of thing. My default jelly for a PB&amp;J isn&rsquo;t even jelly at all. It&rsquo;s strawberry jam. I know grape jelly is the default jelly for most people there, but I like strawberry better. FIGHT ME.

<p>
 Somehow you&rsquo;re both wrong. I don&rsquo;t think a last name is a nickname, but I definitely think a nickname can contain parts of your given name. &ldquo;Pat&rdquo; is, technically speaking, a nickname. It&rsquo;s not the wildest nickname in the world, but it does the job a nickname is supposed to do, which is to make your name shorter and punchier, and take away some of the formality of addressing you. You don&rsquo;t need to go by Cobra or something to have a true nickname. You can be Patty, or P, or P-Funk, or P-Sauce, or whatever the fuck. It can be an alternate name or a shortened name or initials or anything else where you can tell a girl, &ldquo;Yes, my name is Eugene but my friends call me PISTOL.&rdquo;

 No. If you&rsquo;re in bed and you&rsquo;re still miserable, it&rsquo;s only natural to think of alternatives while you&rsquo;re desperate for comfort. I&rsquo;ve had that happen, where I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Maybe if I lie on the floor, I won&rsquo;t want to throw up so much.&rdquo; And then I move one inch and NOPE. No, it turns out that this is about as un-miserable as I&rsquo;m going to get. It&rsquo;s not a good moment. If the bed isn&rsquo;t working, that&rsquo;s when you know you&rsquo;re fucked.

 It&rsquo;s also fun to sleep on the floor just for the sheer drama of it. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m just so exhausted, I&rsquo;ll sleep right here on the floor of this bus station.&rdquo; I had to sleep on the floor of the nursery a few times when we were new parents.

As I was leaving, I wondered if there could be a less efficient method with even less chance of success to kill someone, than cutting a car&rsquo;s brake lines. How fast could you be going before you first use the brakes? 5mph while backing out of your driveway? Even then, a car crash would most likely end up with bumps and bruises.

If you cut someone&rsquo;s brakes, it&rsquo;s not because you necessarily want to kill them, but because you want them to KNOW that you want to kill them. See the difference? It&rsquo;s a mind game.
