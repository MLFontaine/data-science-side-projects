  What happens to coaches in the fourth quarter against the Patriots? Why do they shit their pants and make decisions that make no sense?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Because of the LEGENDARY POWAH OF WAHLBERG NATION. In all seriousness though, I remember back when Tiger was ripping off Major wins all over the place. A lot of times, he wasn&rsquo;t necessarily playing his best golf, but the field would wilt around him. Golfers openly talked about his mystique, and how daunting it was to win a tournament knowing Tiger was out there, ready to crush them. He&rsquo;s just a broken-down, horny old guy now. But back then? THE BOGEYMAN.
</p>
<p>
 I think that can happen in team sports as well. The Falcons were playing in only their second Super Bowl (their first with that roster and coaching staff), and they were going up against Tom Brady at his seventh rodeo. Every Super Bowl that the Patriots play in gives them a distinct advantage for the NEXT Super Bowl they play in, and I have to think that occasionally crosses the mind of whoever they&rsquo;re playing. (This is why Eli Manning was their Kryptonite; he&rsquo;s too stupid to feel pressure.) It&rsquo;s only human. The Falcons went up big, and then slumped, and then the Patriots seized upon an opening. And suddenly it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Oh shit, we can&rsquo;t fuck up now because they certainly won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 Now, that&rsquo;s a gross generalization, especially given that we&rsquo;re talking about world-class athletes who are far, far tougher mentally than some random dipshit fan like me. Just as certain NERDY STAT NERDS have debunked the idea of clutch performances, haughty dipshit Gregggggggggggggggg Easterbrook once suggested that
 <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story/_/id/7056133/tmq-says-nfl-comebacks-losing-team-lost-lead" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  choking is also an illusion
 </a>
 , and that teams blow leads because of standard variations in gameplay (and because the winning team is, you know, good).
</p>
<p>
 But ol&rsquo; Gregggggggggg is wrong.
 <a href="http://larrybrownsports.com/football/was-marty-schottenheimer-all-jacked-up-on-mountain-dew/128" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  Here&rsquo;s a great old rumor
 </a>
 about Marty Schottenheimer succumbing to the mystique of these very same Patriots a decade ago:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Goddamnit, I&rsquo;m so hyped up someone needs to get over here and calm me down.&rdquo; So the special teams coach comes over to him and talks to him and Marty says, &ldquo;I was pulling into the parking lot today and I decided we were going to be aggressive. People don&rsquo;t think I can be aggressive but I decided driving in that we were going to be.&rdquo; And the ST coach says, &ldquo;Coach. You can&rsquo;t let the outside stuff get to you.&rdquo;
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 And remember when Bill Belichick himself went for it on his own 28 against
 <a href="https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/defending-belichicks-fourth-down-decision/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  the Colts
 </a>
 way back when? That was because he knew Peyton Manning was on the other team and could score in a heartbeat! That&rsquo;s cold-blooded analysis with a dash of mystique thrown in. Coaches will always defend their play-calling by describing it as situational, but I think one of the reasons Kyle Shanahan
 <a href="http://deadspin.com/what-the-hell-was-kyle-shanahan-thinking-1792039425" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  went into brain freeze
 </a>
 and kept passing the ball on Sunday night was because he knew, somewhere deep down, that 28 points weren&rsquo;t gonna be enough. Tom Brady always gets his, and it&rsquo;s not crazy to think opponents know that, and even fear it a little.

  On a scale of one to incredible, how amazing has this last nine months of sports been?

Remember when major sports titles used to suck?
 </p>

<p>
 Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s ever been anything quite like this. Off the top of my head, there are some other crazy sports years like 2004, with the Pats beating Carolina at the gun, the Pistons upsetting the Lakers, and the Red Sox finally ending their title drought. But even that can&rsquo;t compare to the run we&rsquo;re currently on, especially given that both the NBA Finals and the World Series went seven games.
</p>
<p>
 I bet this is an amazing time to be, like, a 15-year-old sports fan. I&rsquo;d shit my pants if I were witnessing all this as a horny teen instead of a lame dad. These PAMPERED MILLENIALS are in for a rude awakening when the Finals start sucking again and the Super Bowl goes back to being an &lsquo;80s-style procession of horrible routs. They&rsquo;ll drop sports the second it stops delivering all this kickass melodrama.

 , so if she had jumped to her demise THEN, the NFL could easily have cleaned up the body and held a memorial, then played the game as scheduled. In fact, I guarantee that&rsquo;s the reason why it was pre-recorded in the first place. Can&rsquo;t have the death of a beloved artist ruining an otherwise perfectly good football game.
</p>
<p>
 Yeah yeah, you knew all along. Whatever, I&rsquo;ll self-own with this post, I&rsquo;ve already taken nothing&hellip;
</p>
<p>
 But let&rsquo;s say she actually jumped during halftime, as it was presented on TV. And let&rsquo;s say she plummeted to her doom. I bet they still would have played the game. They would have taken her away in an ambulance and then the broadcasters would promise you updates on her status right as they can get them (questionable to return!), and then the two blissfully ignorant teams would trot back out and keep playing, serving as a WELCOME DISTRACTION to your grief over Gaga falling to her demise. They&rsquo;re not canceling shit. This is TV &hellip; they can report and process something horrifying and then move on within SECONDS. Goodell would probably conspire with Pepsi Coke Zero to order the field cleaned up immediately just so claims adjusters would have no crime scene to examine. And Buck and Aikman would affect the proper levels of solemnity when discussing the accident&hellip;

 BUCK: (between plays) Obviously, our thoughts and prayers are with Lady Gaga and her family at this time.

 By the way, I totally bought that she was up on that roof at the start of the show. I was really worried about her falling. Would have killed my WHOLE buzz.

  Let&rsquo;s make two football teams, one comprised of nothing but the 30 NFL starting punters and the other comprised of nothing but the six best offensive lines during the 2016 season, so you have a team of punters at every position versus a team of O-lineman at every position. They play one full game. Who wins?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The O-linemen. Remember: FOOTBALL GAMES ARE WON IN THE TRENCHES. Whatever advantage the punters have in quickness would be violently erased by the vicious beating they would take along the line of scrimmage. They&rsquo;d have no time to throw the ball and no support running it.
 <br/>

 And it&rsquo;s not as if linemen aren&rsquo;t athletic. Joe Thuney of the Patriots runs the 40 in under five seconds. He&rsquo;d truck a defense of Lechlers.

<p>
 Of course you can&rsquo;t ignore them. It&rsquo;s a pair of halogen beams sent from some asshole&rsquo;s BMW to directly attack your retinas and cause you to get into a fiery wreck, so that they don&rsquo;t have to share the road with anyone. A lot of those high beams aren&rsquo;t even high beams. They&rsquo;re just regular headlights, but still brighter than the fucking sun. This has angered me for a long time. Why are these lights not regulated? IS TRUMP IN BED WITH BIG WATTAGE?!

 The worst is when you get those halogens caught in a side mirror and can&rsquo;t shake them. I&rsquo;ve nearly had a heart attack trying to maneuver a pair of overly bright headlights out of my side mirror. It&rsquo;s like they deliberately camp out there to murder you.

<p>
 Yeah, don&rsquo;t bother with socks or shoes for newborns. Baby shoes are fucking worthless. That Hemingway short story isn&rsquo;t sad at all. It&rsquo;s perfectly logical for them to never be worn. Never buy them as a gift unless you enjoy publicly announcing that you have wasted money. The only reason to put shoes on a baby is for looks. The baby hates them. The baby is like, &ldquo;Wahhhhhhh what the fuck are you doing to my perfect little feet?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 If you need to keep a newborn&rsquo;s feet warm, you can put them in a onesie with footies, or wrap their little trotters in a blanket. When my kids were babies, we also had these cotton gowns that were basically long shirts with elastic at the bottom, to seal in the baby&rsquo;s feet and stew them in their natural juices. Those gowns were much more useful than socks. A baby sock is ASKING to be lost. There are probably 700 baby socks hidden in the crevices of this house. You could make a game of it.

  Here is a hot take: biscuits and gravy sucks. Biscuits are great because they are flaky and buttery and airy. Once you dump a bunch of quickly-congealing gravy on it, the biscuit becomes soggy and mushy, plus the actual flavor of gravy is not as good as the biscuit flavor it overpowers.
 </p>

<p>
 I feel like you just issued your own death warrant. Every professional southerner on the Internet is gonna come for you now, you filthy Yankee. GUMBO GUMBO GUMBO NOW YOU AIN&rsquo;T HAD BISCUITS AND GRAVY TILL YOU HAD MY MAWMAW&rsquo;S BISCUITS AND GRAVY.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, my take is that biscuits and gravy are perfectly good. I rarely order it, because it&rsquo;s death on a plate (and most places offer SAUSAGE gravy; they may as well cut your throat right at the table). But everyone likes bread dunked in fatty liquid. It&rsquo;s pretty much the same dynamic here. It helps if the biscuits are made from scratch and the gravy isn&rsquo;t white glop. I demand my gravy be made only from the finest homemade stocks whisked into a loving roux.
</p>
<p>
 In theory, I&rsquo;m with you on smothered foods. You just fried up a crispy piece of chicken. Why are you gonna douse it in gravy or some other shit? Seems like it would ruin the precious TEXTURAL elements, but no. When it&rsquo;s done right, the crispy parts stay crisp and the sauce coats it all in salty ecstasy. Plus, the liquid cools off the big bite so that you don&rsquo;t incinerate the inside of your cheeks. Everyone wins.
</p>
<p>
 By the way, I&rsquo;m gonna doxx my wife here and tell you that her favorite drunk food is fries and gravy. Poutine without the cheese, basically. At 3 a.m., it has curative powers. Gravy is an antibiotic at that hour.

 , you&rsquo;re not gonna see this again. Brady has the skills of Joe Montana and the longevity of George fucking Blanda. And he&rsquo;s done it all while playing his home games outside! It&rsquo;s insane, and it&rsquo;s gonna be virtually impossible for anyone to duplicate his accomplishments in an NFL that is still structured to break apart loaded teams, AND with players much more willing to retire early because of concussion fears.
</p>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s inevitable that other great players are gonna come along and rise to prominence while Brady&rsquo;s career recedes into the past. Dormant bar arguments always get kicked up again, if only because guys have nothing better to do. But no, I think we&rsquo;ll all die with Brady as the GOAT. He&rsquo;ll go out with six or seven Lombardis, and then take a sweet gig as Emperor Trump&rsquo;s ambassador to the new Russian Virgin Islands.

 , because A) Vaping lets you smoke in a lot of places where smoking is no longer allowed, B) No one gives you dirty looks for puffing away, C) You can put weed in it, and D) People think e-cigarettes are healthier than normal cigarettes, even though nicotine on its own can cause a lot of health problems. Vaping offers more excuses to smoke, along with the mild illusion that it&rsquo;s not as harmful as the real thing.
</p>
<p>
 My parents quit smoking before I was born, and my mom said the hardest part of quitting was that she missed having a cigarette in her hand. She would often hold an unlit cigarette just to quell the urges. I think, buzz aside, vaping offers the same kind of satisfaction. People like having their little smoke break, something to preoccupy them from other shit they&rsquo;d rather not do. Also, I think people who vape think it looks cooler than it actually does. It&rsquo;s like driving a muscle car. Look at the

I thought I&rsquo;d been let down every way I could by the Falcons, Braves, Hawks, and my GEORGIA DAWGS, but this is a hollow feeling I didn&rsquo;t even think possible. My question is one being tossed around talk radio and message boards down here: is that maybe the worst way to lose a championship game? Can you think of another franchise in any sport that blew such a chance? Would it have been better to have been blown out from the get-go and not have the torture of thinking of the Super Bowl Champions gear you were gonna buy and if you&rsquo;d play hooky from work for the Parade?

<p>
 I think the huge blown lead is the worst way to lose. That Super Bowl had echoes of the infamous Bills/Oilers game, where Buffalo came back from being down 35-3 by just methodically chipping away until suddenly Houston&rsquo;s lead had vanished. I was rooting for Houston in that game (I liked Warren Moon when I was a kid; I&rsquo;ve got a real knack for picking &lsquo;em), and I remember the overwhelming dread that came as the Bills got closer and closer. That dread is the worst. That&rsquo;s the shit that haunts you until death, because you spend hours and hours ruminating on

<p>
 It also sucks to lose on some kind of once-in-a-lifetime play and/or last-second mistake, like the Music City Miracle or the Miracle at the Meadowlands. But you can at least comfort yourself by treating those moments as strange flukes. With a blown lead, there&rsquo;s no one small cosmic accident to blame. It&rsquo;s definitively your dumb team&rsquo;s fault, and that&rsquo;s hard to accept.
</p>
<p>
 You will also now have to relive that comeback pretty much anytime the Falcons play. They&rsquo;re gonna have the footage queued up and rolling for EVERY game, even preseason shit. That Edelman catch is gonna live inside your TV FOREVER. I suggest you start drinking more.

 I&rsquo;d foul out within the first 60 seconds of gameplay. There&rsquo;d be no choice. If I couldn&rsquo;t foul Russ, he&rsquo;d easily score over 100 points. Shit, he&rsquo;d probably score 150, because he could simply blow by me on every possession, and he&rsquo;d have no reason at all to pass the ball out. So what other recourse would I have? I&rsquo;d have to play HACK A RUSS, and karate chop his forearms at every opportunity (if I could even catch him, which is unlikely). I&rsquo;d even cut block him, like a dirty lineman. I would be like Delly for a full minute before getting tossed and booed out of the stadium tunnel. Then Russ would call me a cheap shot artist in the post-game and it would be 100 percent accurate.
