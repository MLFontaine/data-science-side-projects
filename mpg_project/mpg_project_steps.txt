1. Prepare data for mySQL
   - clean up in Google spreadsheets by reformatting dates for mySQL date format: xx/xx/xxxx to xxxx-xx-xx
   - export google spreadsheet to comma delimited csv file

2. Import data to new mysql table
   - login to mysql on command line
   - USE mpg_db;
   - create table and load date with: source /Users/MF/Desktop/data-science-side-projects/mpg_project/creatempgtable.mysql; (from within mysql session, could also do from shell)
   - SELECT * FROM mpg_table to see the whole table, and DESCRIBE mpg_table to see fields
 
* Data analysis and visualization in the following steps to be placed in mpg_analysis.R

3. Import table into R
   - use libraries dplyr and RMySQL with RStudio
   -  db <- dbConnect(MySQL(), dbname = "mpg_db", host = "localhost", default.file = "~/.my.cnf", user = NULL, password = NULL)
   - mpgs <- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT * FROM mpg_table")
   
   - Alternative steps, loads data in different type
   - db <- src_mysql("mpg_db", default.file = "~/.my.cnf", user = NULL, password = NULL)   (default file has username and password)
   - mpgs <- tbl(db, "mpg_table")
   - collect(mpgs) (brings in whole table)
   
4. Data Analysis in R
   - use library ggplot2
   - g <- ggplot(data = mpgs, aes(y = mpg, x = thedate))
   - g + geom_point(size = 3) these two commands plot out mpg over date
    
   - h <- ggplot(data = mpgs, aes(y = mpg, x = mpd))
   - h + geom_point(size = 3)
    
    
    -do linear regressions
    -costco gas prices over time
    -calculate means, standard deviations, number of visits to each station
    -costco gas savings
    -stick into markdown or something similar
    -difference after new tires
    -no difference after tune up
    -test out clustering to detect tires, or hwy style
    -import air temp from wunderground if possible
    -compare to an mpg database in R?

* Data analysis and visualization in the following steps to be placed in mpg_analysis2.py

5. Import table into Python
   - See http://zetcode.com/db/mysqlpython/. Python packages kind of a mess to get installed...  
   - also see http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html


6. Data analysis in Python
   - run python mpg_analysis2.py from shell, or inside python execfile(‘mpg_analysis2.py’), or using python -i mpg_analysis2.py from shell to go into interactive mode after loading
