 <p>
  Over the entirety of civilized human history, what building
has been farted in the most?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 My first guess was the Pentagon, because it's one of the
largest buildings in the world and it undoubtedly has a secret network of vast
underground tunnels and chambers where Department of Defense workers sit in
command chairs all day, ordering assassinations and farting to their heart's
content.
</p>
<p>
 But the Pentagon has only been around for 70 years, making
it a relatively new building as far as human history goes.  I doubt it holds a candle to the Coliseum,
which is nearly 2,000 years old and has been host to millions upon millions of
farting spectators and gladiatorial enthusiasts. 
Ancient Romans used to barf and piss and fart all over each other for
pleasure, so I bet they freely broke wind while watching Maximus fight off
hordes of lions.  And the building is now
host the throngs of tourist groups, and it's easy to stand in the middle of a
tourist group and fart your brains out, all the while blaming the group of
Estonians trailing right behind you. 
Tourist spots are nothing filthy havens of butt fumes and expensive
postcards.  Avoid them.

  Suppose a Tomlin-esque incident happens in the Super Bowl
with no time left in the game and the returning team down by 4, where a coach
or player on the sideline tackles the return man to prevent a surefire
touchdown.  Do they award the victim team a TD? Also, what kind of
punishment does the sideline offender receive?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The refs have the discretion to award a touchdown based on a
patently unfair act, so that's probably what would happen in that
instance.  The offending coach would
probably be banned from the NFL "for life," only to have that ban
appealed down to two years.  Only the
California penal system has a more forgiving parole policy.
</p>
<p>
 The Tomlin incident is a bit different in that Tomlin was
subtle enough to not get caught right away, and so you could have a scenario
where the refs miss it and the Super Bowl ends and NFL officials can't reverse
the score right there on the spot, because they can't definitively say what the
coach's intentions were without a thorough investigation.  THAT would be a fucking disaster, which is
why the NFL decided to drop the hammer on the Steelers this week for the
jab-step.  If it happened in the last
minute of a Super Bowl, the NFL would probably let the result stand (the longer
a score remains final, the harder it is for a league to reverse, and the more
people line up to take sides to argue the result endlessly) and then have
Tomlin buried alive.

  I, a solidly middle-aged adult, just got braces.  These
things are a giant pain in the ass, and every day I seem to find some new
source of agony or inconvenience coming my way.  However, I know a bunch
of kids ranging in age from 8 to 18 who have braces and they act like it's no
big deal.  They're chomping away on sandwiches and fried chicken and
Pop-Tarts while I can barely get through a bowl of applesauce without wanting
to cry.  So here's my question:  What other things can you think of
that seem to be no big deal to kids, but bring adults to their knees?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I just had a snow day with my kids and kids give zero fucks
about wet clothing or getting snow down their crack.  I remember this distinctly from when I was a
kid: I could stay out in the cold for hours and hours in wet jeans, with rivers
of snot pouring out of my nose, and I wouldn't really care until I got inside
and realized that I was on the verge of death. 
Kids have a higher tolerance for pain and they are far, far less aware
of danger than you or I are.  Half my
life is now spent shouting at my kids DON'T DO THAT, THAT WILL KILL YOU.

<blockquote>
 <p>
  How many GMs and Coaches do you think are on twitter
anonymously? You know, with one of those no name egg avatar accounts. Most of
them say they don't "pay attention to the twitter tweets", but I bet
there are quite a few to get an idea of what's written about them or what other
teams are doing. Example: lane Kiffin, 100% has an egg account
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I don't think there are many, mainly because head coaches
are already pressed for time.  They are a
paranoid, socially inept lot, which means they'd be PERFECT for Twitter, but
being a head coach means having a to-do list that is never, ever blank: If
you're not watching tape endlessly, you're scouting college players (or high
school players), or plotting out practice schedules, or fulfilling one of 800
media requests, or asking your quarterback if he really DID rape that
girl.  There's no time for them to set up
an anonymous Twitter account, and most of them pride themselves on being
technophobic anyway.  Twitter is for
NERDY CRITIC NERDS.
</p>
<p>
 No, what the average head coach will do is find a toady to
go out to compile all enemies and/or threats to his precious authority in the
form of tweets, columns, leaks to reporters, etc.  Then he will stew and scheme and scheme and
stew until he's found the perfect way to get Dan Snyder to fire him.

  What if The Ginger Hammer decided to make the Super Bowl pay
per view?  Would it be the highest PPV
program ever? Would it still be a big deal?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It would be the highest PPV ever but everyone would hate his
fucking guts for it.  I live in fear of
this happening, because the NFL has the average fan over a barrel.  Let's face it: If you have the means (or even
if you don't), you'd pay pretty much anything for Sunday Ticket and the NFL's
slate of primetime games.  One of the
only reasons I still have cable TV is because MNF is on ESPN.  If ESPN didn't control a hefty number of live
sporting events, I would tell cable to kiss my pale white ass.  But they do, and so I pay without hesitation.  If they charged me more, I would pay it.  And if they put the playoffs on PPV, I would
bitch and moan and then pony up because, in my mind, I have no choice.  I don't have the balls to let four decades of
fandom fall by the wayside.  THAT WOULD
MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FLAKE!  I'm too proud

</p>
<p>
 The only reason the NFL hasn't fucked you over with a PPV
Super Bowl is because it isn't worth the higher profits to shrink the
audience.  The hundred million people
that tune into the Super Bowl have a long-term benefit to the NFL in terms of
merch sales, potential new fans of the sport, and so on.  That value trumps the pile of money a PPV
would bring in, even if we're talking about 40 million people paying $100 a
pop.  The expense would erode the casual audience
further and further until it was a freak niche sport, the way boxing is
today.  I like boxing, but not enough to
pay a steak dinner for it.  If you aren't
a diehard, lifelong football fan, you will have an economic breaking point, and
PPV charges get you there in a hurry.

 <p>
  I'm a drug addict. I'm 22 years old, and last fall I had to
withdraw from school to go to rehab for opiates. So I guess I'm wondering if
I'm the manifestation a parents' absolute worst fear when it comes to raising
kids. Like, do my parents feel like complete and total failures because -
despite doing everything in their power to ensure practically any other outcome
- I ended up addicted to drugs? Or does the fear of your child becoming a drug
addict have more to do with the perceived misery that such a life entails?
 </p>
 <p>
  Because, aside from the whole drug addict thing, I think I'm
a pretty decent kid. I'm back in school, and I believe there's still a pretty
decent chance I end up becoming a happy, well-adjusted, contributing member of
society. I feel like I'd rather have a kid like me than a complete square
incapable of taking risks, spending his entire life coloring inside the lines.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think the reason most parents fear their children becoming
addicted to drugs is that many drug addicts, you know, DIE.  Death is every parent's worst fear, and drug
addiction is one of many quick paths to realizing it.  That would be my major concern if my son came
home with a bag of krokodil and half an arm. 
So of course your parents will feel some measure of guilt&mdash;whether it's
rational or not&mdash;because they couldn't keep you out of harm's way.  Not all drug addicts survive, and not all of
them beat their demons.  I fear my
children dying.  I fear that they will be
unhappy.  I fear that they will commit
crimes.  I fear that they will be
degraded by other people. 
Assaulted.  Shot.  Violated. 
All that horrible stuff.  I live
with those fears every single day and they don't go away, ever.  I want my kids to go out and experience all
the joys and pain of life, but that doesn't mean I want them to check out the
 <em>
  entirety
 </em>
 of life's gutter, because lots
of people don't make it back.  If I'm
overly cautious, that's just because it's the nature of the job.  No one else is gonna be overly cautious for
you, which is why I spend half my day begging my oldest kid to not accidentally
shake my youngest kid to death.
</p>
<p>
 I'm all for my kids taking MEASURED risks.  Like quitting a job they dislike and trying a
new career.  That's risky, and does not
involve potentially doling out handjobs at truck stops for crack money.  There is a dark, seedy, ruthless side to the
world and I'll always do my best to keep my kids from getting trapped there
forever.
</p>
<p>
 But it's great that you're back in school and beating your
addictions back.  If my kid DID end up
being a drug addict, I wouldn't just sit there and tell my kid YOU ARE MY WORST
NIGHTMARE all day long.  I'd go to
meetings with them and give them support and chase dealers off of my stoop with
a bat.  YOU GIT THE HELL OFF MY POPPITY.

<blockquote>
 <p>
  After college in the late-80's, my uncle and his friend
decided to backpack around South America. We're talking deep in the Amazon - I
forget if it was Colombia, Venezuela, or Brazil, but they were deep into the
jungle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some travelbook for backpackers they read about a prison
deep in the jungle that allowed travelers to sleep overnight for cheap (I
forget if the prison was active, or if it was a former prison now held by
guerrillas as a fort). I have no idea why they thought this was a good idea,
but they did. They arrived late in the evening and paid the guards/guerrillas
for the stay - but the guards told them that their shift was over soon and that
they should be quiet when the new shift came on because they would make them
pay again, and might not be so nice.
 </p>
 <p>
  They did as they were told and stayed quiet. However, in the
middle of the night they were awoken by what was clearly a woman being assaulted
by the guards. Terrified of being killed if they tried to intervene, they
stayed as silent as they could and snuck out in the morning when everything
seemed quiet. Would you have said anything?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 No.  Why the fuck
would you voluntarily stay at a jungle prison? 
That's insane.  Why not volunteer
to work at Colonel Kurtz's compound while you're at it?
</p>
<p>
 I would like to think I'd have the gumption to speak up and
defend the poor woman being attacked by those guards, but self-preservation
brings out the coward in most of us, and I'm no exception.  There is a cold calculus you do in your head
in this situation.  If you try to stop
the assault, you likely end up killed and the assault goes on.  And so you do nothing and are haunted by it
until your dying day.  Are you a terrible
person for not risking your life on the sleight chance that you could save that
other person?  There's no definitive way
to say NO to that question.
</p>
<p>
 Ugh.  This fucking
world.  This is the dark side, where
terrible shit happens all the time and normal people are constantly forced to
measure the value of their own bravery.  I hope my kids never discover it, and I wish
my bravery were worth more than a bottle of warm piss.

Baseball.  It's not even

shifts, and football has a million stupid things that a coach has to keep track
of.  Forget it.  Go baseball all the way.  Jason Kidd could do that job.  You could even drink a beer.  DUGOUT BEER IS #1 ON MY BEER LIST.

 I usually use a fork because every ice cream cake I've ever
had arrives solid as a fucking brick, and so I have to take my fork and chisel
away at the fucker to make any headway. 
In a perfect world, the cake is cold but soft enough to yield to a
spoon, so that I might enjoy it without tearing my goddamn labrum.

 <p>
  I live outside of Philadelphia and have noticed that people
frequently fill their cars up with gas then walk in to the store to buy things;
leaving their car to take up a gas pump while people are literally circling the
parking lot looking for an open pump.  I can see how this is not an issue
when it's, say, night time or on a weekend.  But at 7am on a
weekday and everyone is scrambling like maniacs to get to work&hellip;.why?!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think people do this because a) They think they will be
quick getting in and out of the store to buy their beef jerky, and b) They are
oblivious to your suffering.  Imagine
that you're at a crowded restaurant waiting for a table, and you see a table
that's clearly finished eating and has paid the check, but all the people
linger and linger and linger and OH GOD DO YOU NOT SEE THAT I NEED TO FUCKING
EAT?  Then you finally get your table and
sit down.  Do you give the zero-est of
fucks about anyone else waiting for a table in that restaurant?  NO. 
They don't even cross your mind, and that's how people end up making you
wait at the gas station.  Even if it
doesn't feel like a long time inside the store to you, it feels like HOURS to
the poor fucker waiting for your pump.
</p>
<p>
 When I hit the gas station, I always stick the pump in, flip
the lock if the pump has one (all stations without little lock thingies should
be burned), and then run in to buy my snacks WHILE the gas is pumping.  I think that's fair.  Also, if you have a big car and you park your
car so far away from the pump that no other cars can scooch past you, you suck.

  I have a really nice pair of headphones that I use a lot,
but when I'm not using them they go on the floor next to my bed, usually
sitting on top of my laptop, but sometimes they make it to the carpet. For a
long time I had been thinking that I should start taking better care of them
and putting them in their case, instead of just tossing them on the floor.
Well, one night I was watching a movie with them and I felt a little tickle on
the outside of my ear. It plainly wasn't an itch. I tore the headphones off and
looked inside. I didn't see anything, so I figured maybe it really was just an
itch, put them back on and continued the movie. Towards the end of it I felt
the same tickle, tore off the headphones again, and there was an earwig just
standing there, moving his earwig antennae every which way and looking a little
lost. I quietly lost my shit, disassembled the headphones and fished the little
bugger out (which took longer than you'd think) and vowed to always, ALWAYS put
my headphones in their case when not in use. I did that for maybe a day. They
now go right back on the floor every night, and every night I think about that
little earwig, cringe a little, and then decide I just can't be bothered to put
those damn headphones in their case. What in the hell is wrong with me? Would
most people change their wicked ways, or would they continue to just toss the
headphones back on to the apparently earwig infested floor?
