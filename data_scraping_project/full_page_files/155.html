  How to Suck
 </a>
 post last week and forgot one last crucial suck point: If you're having a conversation with someone and you really want to suck, be sure to talk exclusively about yourself and NEVER ask the other person how they're doing.  I am consistently amazed at how many motherfuckers out there treat the other person in a conversation like a fucking TV camera.  I'll talk to someone for, like, an hour, and then I'll walk away and be like,
 <em>
  Wait, that asshole didn't ask me anything about me!
 </em>
 <em>
  I'm not even sure he knew my name.
 </em>
 It's like an illness.  So if you're droning on and on about your job to some poor bastard at a cocktail party, take one minute to pause and actually listen to another human being.  No one wants to hear your tiresome horseshit.
</p>
<p>
 This is all about sucking, so I'll begin with me, in a parking lot, parked too close to the&hellip;

  What is the trashiest location for a tattoo on a woman? I instantly thought of the tried and true "tramp stamp," but that isn't it. I narrowed it down to the tattoo on the top of the foot and the absolutely awful "above the breasts" tattoo. I'm not sure if there is a slang term for either of those, but they are both terrible.
 </p>
 <p>
  My trashiest tattoo rankings would start like this:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) Above the breasts
 </p>
 <p>
  2) Top of the foot

 <p>
  3) Wrist

<p>
 What about on the labia?  You know you've a got a party when your lady has a tattooed labia.  Anyway, I'll agree with the top of the titty for maximum trashiness, particularly if it's a very large tattoo.  Two breasts simply weren't enough: You had to throw a fucking dragon up there to get me to look.  That's quality.  Here's what my rankings look like:

 who ripped on Colin Kaepernick for having tats.  Meanwhile, I'm a suburban white dad who will view himself as a complete fucking failure if his kids get inked up.  If you told me I could pay $1,000 bucks to insure my kids never get tats or fucking nose rings, I'd pay it.  I'll TOTALLY judge you if you get a ring of thorns tatted around your flabby-ass bicep.  Who's your daddy, tattoo boy?  YOU ARE NOT FIT TO LEAD.

 By the way, I'm always amazed at how many tattoo magazines exist in the world.  Go to New York and you'll see entire newsstand racks devoted to shitty tat magazines.  I feel like there are mergers in the tattoo publishing industry that should have taken place long ago.

 Oh, Jameis Winston.  It's not even close.  He could end up winning two Heismans and two national titles; he may have committed sexual assault; he stole crab legs; he has a stupid nickname (Famous Jameis); and he'll go way high in the draft next year unless teams are put off by the whole "he may have committed sexual assault" thing.  He's like a

</p>
<p>
 I guarantee you that, prior to next year's draft, a large number of bravely anonymous NFL scouts will tell Peter King that Winston is only a marginal talent and has BIG question marks.  Why, I wouldn't draft him until round five!  A lot of these scouts treat hyped prospects like hipsters ripping on a popular album.

 <p>
  Does Aaron Hernandez count as a serial murderer now?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Possibly!  One of the definitions of serial murdering from the FBI is "the unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s), in separate events," which is precisely what Hernandez is alleged to have done.  This is not a definitively agreed-upon definition by serial-killing experts (I imagine them all drinking black coffee and poring over photos of dismembered corpses scattered on a very large conference-room table), but if you would like to accuse Aaron Hernandez of being a serial killer, no one could tell you that you're 100 percent wrong.
</p>
<p>
 However, I have my own specific definition of serial killing that comes from watching awful TV shows and movies for over three decades.  To me, a serial killer is a middle-aged white dude.  Thick glasses.  Probably a little soft around the middle.  Killed and tortured animals for sport as a child.  Due to some kind of horrible childhood trauma, the serial killer now spends his days working at a job that requires relatively little social interaction (no one suspects the sewage plant worker!), and his nights stalking and killing WOMEN or VERY SMALL CHILDREN.  He has a painstaking selection process (not unlike NFL scouts!), and will spend months if not years planning every ritual murder.  And he'll totally have a signature move or weapon.  Like a bowie knife or something.  Pentagrams will also be deployed.
</p>
<p>
 And then the serial killer breaks into your house and drags you to the basement and ties you down and performs strange sexual experiments on you and then cuts out your inner organs and eats them and makes you watch an iPhone video of it.  Then he beats off on your corpse.  And he smiles when he does it, which is really fucking creepy.
</p>
<p>
 THAT is what I picture a serial killer to be.  This is why I am not scared or disturbed by Aaron Hernandez.  I just think of him as a garden-variety murderous scumbag, like a Mafia hitman or something like that.  There's something far more reassuring about that kind of killer.
 <em>
  Oh, he doesn't choose his victims randomly.  He kills his friends!
 </em>
 For some reason, that doesn't chill my bones.  But it should!  It's not like a serial killer who kills three people is somehow worse than any other murderer of three people.  This is why the broader definition of serial killing is useful.  It reminds you that ALL murder is scary.  I'm sure Odin Lloyd was just as terrified when he was killed as any other murder victim.  I would personally prefer that all my murderers kill for something OTHER than pure pleasure, but that's irrational on my part.  I probably shouldn't have watched
 <em>

 so many times.

 In all seriousness, I think a Michael Sam sex tape could easily be explained away.  He could just say it was an old tape and that he was still sorting things out.  Rest assured, he's ALL gay man, folks.  It was just a phase, he swears!  DON'T SHUN HIM!

  What is the long snapper of instruments?  We recently started piano lessons for our seven-year-old girl.

What is the instrument that one would have the highest chance to perform at a high level with the least amount of inherited musical ability? Oboe? Harpsichord?

<p>
 I was gonna say the triangle, but no symphony employs a dude to just man the triangle.  That's the job of a multi-tasking percussionist who also has to man the chimes and the kettle drum and the gong.  Sometimes I'll see footage of a symphony and the percussionist will have to stand there like a pud for five minutes before nailing the gong at the exact right moment and I'll think to myself,
 <em>
  Hey, I could do that!
 </em>
 But no, I would fuck that up.  Probably 5,000 drummers applied to bang that gong.
</p>
<p>
 I can't play any instrument, so I'm taking a stab in the dark here, but my guess for the luge of instruments would be the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  tin whistle
 </a>
 , which is basically a glorified recorder.  It's got six holes.  You don't need any lung power to blow into it and make a noise.  There's no tricky reed for you to drool all over.  Seems easy enough.  But of course, there are probably five million micromanaging tin-whistle parents out there thinking the same thing.  Only one can be the next Sean Potts!  If only there was a shortcut to achieving his legendary stature.
</p>
<p>
 My oldest kid takes piano lessons.  I have no illusions about her becoming a famed concert pianist or composer.  But we went to a talent show at her school a while back, and some of the kids could rip off Mozart concertos with their fucking eyes closed.  And then I felt like a terrible parent for not forcing my kid to sit at a bench with a stern piano teacher for 40 minutes every week, working on tedious scales.  So we set up lessons.  She now plays "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" with only a couple of botched notes.  HARVARD HERE WE COME.
</p>
<p>
 I always wished I could play an instrument.  There's no better way of instantly impressing people than picking up an instrument and unleashing a torrent of gorgeous melodies.  My God, it's a side of Jim we've never seen before!  It's like when Bill Murray takes lessons in
 <em>
  Groundhog Day

 and blows Andie MacDowell away when she discovers he can play.  Man, that looked badass.  I'd pay three dollars for that ability.  Why does playing an instrument have to be so fucking hard?  I hate working.

 Yeah, but the NBA would never go for this, because then you'd have 80 players passing up the open man just to get an extra shot at the $5 million.  You'd turn every team into the Knicks, basically.

 Anyway, I have two sons, and I'm already mentally preparing my speech for when they turn 13 and meet a girl and want that girl so badly they'll nuke the rest of the fucking earth to ensure that they're the only people left remaining.  And then that girl will reject them, and it will take them, oh, let's say a solid decade to finally get over it.  The worst part is that I already know this speech of mine will fall on deaf ears.  I'll talk to them about all the fish in the sea, and that leverage is the willingness to walk away from the negotiating table with nothing, and they'll just roll their eyes the whole time.

 When I was in middle school, I went bonkers for one girl.  I told her I loved her a zillion times.  I called her at all hours of the day, sometimes even singing to her.  One time she slow danced with me and I got to smell her hair and wanted to eat her.  I loved her.  I
 <em>
  loved
 </em>
 her.  My stomach hurt, I loved her so bad.  She kept turning me down, and instead of moving on with my life and mingling with the other three billion females on earth, stupid teenage me was like I DON'T WANT ANY OTHER GIRL OTHER GIRLS ARE SHIT IF I DON'T HAVE HER I'LL FUCKING DIE.  You can't tell a teenage boy anything because they're brain dead.  I can't begin to tabulate all the misplaced rage and self-loathing I felt simply because I was rejected by ONE human being.

 But I don't know that it would do any good.  The only way to gain confidence with women is to spend years and years fucking up with women until you stop giving a shit, at which point women come flocking in DROVES because you care so little.  If only I had done more drugs as a youth.  It would have really helped shift my focus.  My advice to you is to ignore the girl and start selling cocaine.  She'll be on your jock within minutes.

 If it's a standard physical examination, you probably get your heart and lungs checked, your blood pressure measured, your hearing and vision checked, your reflexes tested (I want to buy a reflex-testing hammer), and your blood taken.  No one wants a player with the siffy.
</p>
<p>
 I have to think that NFL teams are a bit more thorough in their exams, perhaps to the limit of what their collective-bargaining agreement says is acceptable.  If I were signing a guy, I would want a full body MRI, a CAT scan, a genome-sequencing run, and an underwater-treadmill test. I would also want to put him through an
 <em>

 -style obstacle course to make sure he's in quality condition.  I would bombard him with x-rays until the bones fell out of his skin.  But I don't think NFL teams do this.  I think that, in general, NFL teams spend 1 percent as much time scrutinizing free agents as they do college players.  Like they'll spend eight days evaluating Johnny Football's Instagram account.  But when some big-name wideout hits the open market?  DURRRR I'M TIRED OF DESEAN JACKSON BEATING US PAY HIM $20 MILLION DURRRR.

  Do you think the world would be better or worse off if all of the world's alcohol just suddenly disappeared one day?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The world would be worse off, and I'm not saying that flippantly.  I know full well that alcohol has destroyed many, many lives.  Millions.  Tens of millions.  Maybe more.  But take a look at the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_alcohol_prohibition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  list of countries
 </a>
 where alcohol use is more or less prohibited: Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Pakistan, etc.  Those places aren't exactly thriving without booze.  As the standard comedy trope goes, maybe Iran would let its hair down a little with a few Straw-Brr-Ritas in it.
</p>
<p>
 Even if you make all the alcohol disappear, you're not magically eliminating all the REASONS why people feel compelled to drink.  There's usually an impetus for drinking.  You drink to excess not just because it's fun (it is!), but because you're lonely or unfulfilled or because that one girl turned you down in middle school and GOD IF ONLY SHE HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW THE REAL ME.  If you get rid of alcohol, people will just find a new vice to comfort themselves: drugs, guns, the systematic disenfranchisement and widespread physical abuse of dissidents, and such and such.  Besides, the world is already overcrowded.  What are we gonna do with 30 million extra sober, healthy people who otherwise would have died from liver failure?  I'm not paying into their Social Security.  Fuck that.

  I play high school football, and recently my coaches decided to make us do a new exercise at the end of each workout. We will either a) put a 25- or 35-pound plate on our forehead or back of our head to work our neck muscles in moving our head forward and backward, or b) wrap a resistance band around part of a rack, put our head in it, and move to each side to work our neck muscles. They told us that this will help prevent concussions. Am I obligated to politely tell my coaches that they are complete dumbasses, since having a strong neck will not prevent our brains from banging around the inside of our skulls, or should I keep my mouth shut and just continue faking the exercise?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 You mean they don't also make you do the neck machine in the "old decrepit Nautilus machine" section of the local gym?  That was the machine my coaches preferred.  It works all four sides of your neck!  You can neck-lift 200 pounds if you really lean into the fucker.  I liked to snap my head to one side and then really strain to push the sweaty face cushion over to the other side.  The fun thing about it is that now my arms don't work.
</p>
<p>
 NFL players have much stronger necks than you, and yet this does very little to prevent them from sustaining concussions.  But your coaches are clearly too stupid to understand this and too stupid to have their methods questioned.  Oh, you don't want to have your head tied to a drag racer to increased necktoid strength?  I GUESS YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF THIS TEAM, SON.  Thank God those guys were certified by the NFL Heads Up program!  I assume they have doctorates as well.

Likewise, if you're some old guy from New York and the '70s Knicks are your favorite wet dream, then you associate him with the Knicks.

  Nearly six years ago (February 29th, 2008 to be precise), I lost my favorite jacket. It was a late night at Carol's Pub on the North Side of Chicago, and in my drunken haze I left it at the bar. I have never regretted anything more. The jacket was similar in weight and composition to
  <a href="http://www.thenorthface.com/catalog/sc-gear/mens-apex-bionic-jacket_3.html?variationId=K9M&amp;variationName=VANADIS%20GREY%20/%20ZINNIA%20ORANGE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   this North Face
  </a>
  . It was light-weight and durable, fit me perfect, and great in the rain and cool weather. I'd love to recommend the brand to anyone, but trouble is I can't tell you the label. I found the jacket on
  <a href="http://overstock.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   overstock.com
  </a>
  one night for $80 but I did not make note of the manufacturer. It also did not have any discernible markings like that obnoxious Mountain Hardware logo.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have gone to the ends of the internet to find it, but have never been able to locate another. It truly was one of a kind. But the best part about the jacket? Everyone was super jealous they didn't have one. It was that awesome. People would constantly ask where I got it, to which I would reply, "Sorry, dude, can't help." I felt so powerful having something that no one else could possibly own. It was like having my own unicorn or dodo bird or playmate girlfriend. I got it, you don't.  As much as I loved the jacket itself, I loved the attention it brought me even more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then came that fateful leap day and my world was flipped upside down. Will I ever be happy again? Am I a horrible person for enjoying the jealousy of others? The only other person on this earth who could possibly relate is the bastard who found it at Carol's and is undoubtedly wearing it right now. If that person is reading this Funbag, I have a message for you: Cherish that jacket with all your soul. And fuck you.
