  I have a 2-year-old that has a bit of a unibrow. Not an Anthony Davis unibrow, but noticeable. Does it make me shallow and superficial to secretly want to get it waxed or use some sort of hair removal product on it?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Of course not. It's perfectly acceptable to stare at your children and pick apart their physical appearance. As someone who was teased and struggled to make friends in elementary school, I have the deep-seated fear that my children will suffer through the same kind of bullshit, and so I frequently examine them for possible weak points for other children to exploit.
 <em>
  Are their teeth properly aligned? Are they lacking in facial symmetry? Are they fat? No seriously, are they getting fat? I think I saw a little tummy jiggle in the tub last night. God, please don't let them be fat and unhappy and left alone to cry on prom night PLEASE GOD NO.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 So yeah, I know the feeling. The problem is that you can't obsess over that sort of thing. At a certain point, your worries begin to take their toll on the child. In an ironic twist, you bestow upon them the insecurity you never wanted them to have, and then they turn to drugs and hooking. So leave that unibrow alone. If the kid wants it plucked 10 years from now, let them decide. Otherwise, their first memory will be of Daddy holding them down and raking a Gillette Venus across their forehead, and that's probably bad.

  Is it possible to kick somebody out of your long-standing fantasy football league and still remain friends with them?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I doubt it. I was in a league this offseason that ousted its commissioner. We banded together and started a new league without telling him, and since then we haven't heard a word from him. And the longer he goes without responding, the more I fear he's purchased an arsenal and is preparing to hunt us down one by one, to murder us all and chop us up and hang us out to air dry for jerky meat. It could happen. Unless the reasons are obvious (your friend never adjusts his lineup anymore and shows a clear disinterest and would probably be relieved to be kicked out), it's a friendship-killer.

  Why hasn't ESPN learned how long a college football game takes to broadcast? I don't think I've watched a game in the past three years that hasn't gone at least 40 minutes past its allotted time slot. I'm sick of having to set my DVR to record an hour and half beyond the end of the program to make sure I see everything. Just allow at least 3.5 hours, and if for some reason a random game ends a few minutes earlier, send it back to the d-bags in the studio until the next time slot starts.

 this fall, but they only bumped it ahead half an hour, so it STILL gets delayed virtually every week. I know that NBC has first dibs on certain highlights for its terrible pre-game show, but CBS could still extend postgame coverage to 8 p.m. and show stats and recreations of game footage using Claymation monkeys.
</p>
<p>
 Of course, you can go too far with this. If you record a game on Sunday Ticket, DirecTV usually assigns it a timeslot that's roughly seven hours long. And then the DVR is like, "You cannot record this AND Nick Jr. AND
 <em>

 </em>
 all at once!" And then you're like FUCK YOU, DVR! I WANT WHAT I WANT. And then you have to manually adjust the recording so that it stops 90 minutes earlier, which is so totally inconvenient. Meanwhile, eight Syrian rebels were murdered in the time it took for you to read this paragraph.

<p>
 In other words, what venue will offer you the finest selection of women? The obvious answers are either the Playboy Mansion or a strip club/nightclub, but I'd also recommend virtually any casting session. I was at a casting session once for a TV ad, and after the actress left, the director turned to me and said: "Goddamn, the rack on that one. I'm trying to stay professional here, but JEEEEESUS."

 <p>
  I love Five Guys' fries, but let's be honest we all go there for the orgasm inducing burgers. Well, my biggest problem with this surplus of fries is for some Godforsaken reason, they decide to put the burger at the bottom. So naturally I stick my hand in that bag of freshly cooked food digging for that burger, but I always end up getting third degree burns from those little bastard fries. Seriously, fuck that guy who decided, "hey lets put the best part of the meal at the bottom of the bag and see how many morons it takes to figure out how to get it out unscathed." What's the best way to attack this dilemma?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The ideal way to deal with problem would be to grab a tray, rip open the bottom of the bag, and let all the food fall out onto the tray, leaving you easy access to the sweet, juicy, meaty burger tucked inside. The only problem with this plan is that Five Guys, at least in my experience, has NO TRAYS. This is a serious fucking problem, because I always count on my fast-food joint to give me a tray. The tray provides me with the critical illusion that I'm eating off a clean surface. I have no fucking idea if they wash their trays or if they just leave them for hobos to sleep on. All I know is that I'm eating off a tray, I feel safe, and if I'm eating off a bare table, I feel like I'm eating garbage right off the street. WHERE'S THE TRAY? THIS IS NOT AFGHANISTAN!
</p>
<p>
 Whenever I go to McDonald's or some other fast-food joint, I try to make sure I get trays for everyone, because if you don't, then you either try to end up sharing a tray (horrible), or fucking someone over by forcing him to eat right off the table. Ever lay down a napkin as a makeshift placemat at McDonald's?
 <em>
  Here, let me unfold this napkin and dump all the fries on top. That'll totally keep the E. coli away.

 And ripping apart the bag and eating off of it is even worse. Must we live like this?

 Seriously though, this does happen to the best of us, though perhaps not in such obvious fashion. I mean, we've all gone to take a shower before and discovered&mdash;with absolute horror&mdash;a wad of TP that wasn't fully removed the last time we were taking a shit. That's such a terrible moment.

 I went to a prep school and one of the games we played was called Spa-TING. You threw a ball around and if you dropped it, you had to pull your pants down, hold the ball between your legs, and jump around in circles screaming out
 <em>
  Spa-TING! Spa-TING! Spa-TING!
 </em>
 (Note: Prep schools are fucked-up places). Anyway, we're playing this outside one day and one kid drops the ball and has to drop trou. And when he started Spa-TING!ing, there was a ribbon of toilet paper streaming out from the leg of his boxers. Then we all pointed at him and died laughing. I'm sure he's told his therapist about it.

 The answer is A, because you'll be remembered forever and have perennial access to your college campus and all the attractive co-eds housed therein.

  Last week at my bachelor party, 10 guys went out to lunch at a casual restaurant. When I was done stuffing my face, I engaged in my usual routine of "throwing in the towel" - taking my napkin off of my lap and placing it on my plate - in an effort to stop myself from further overeating. Have you ever taken the napkin back off and resumed eating?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I have, and it's so depressing. You feel like a complete failure. You also get angry at yourself for throwing the napkin on your food too early. LOOK HOW YOU MADE ME FEEL, YOU DICK. I've put the napkin on my plate, carried the plate to the kitchen, and then removed the napkin IN the kitchen and then feasted on the leftovers by the garbage can. It's repugnant behavior. That napkin is meant to be a hard line that transforms your dinner into garbage and prevents you from eating it. And yet, that only makes me want it more. I have issues.

<blockquote>
 <p>
  If you had to chose one calendar month to stay sober, what month would be the easiest?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The obvious answer is February, since it's the shortest month. But February has the Super Bowl AND it seems like the longest month of the year, which makes abstinence difficult. A skilled alcoholic uses virtually any occasion to celebrate, and every month has its share of festive occasions:
</p>
<p>
 January: NFL playoffs
 <br/>
 February: Super Bowl
 <br/>
 March: NCAA tourney
 <br/>
 April: First glimpse of warm weather
 <br/>
 May: Memorial Day
 <br/>
 June: General summer drinking, vacation
 <br/>
 July: Fourth of July
 <br/>
 August: Horrible awful end of summer, drinking needed to pass the time
 <br/>
 September: Football again! DRANK.
 <br/>
 October: More football, World Series
 <br/>
 November/December: Holidays
</p>
<p>
 As you can see, that's a packed drinking calendar, and it doesn't include obvious drinking occasions like birthdays, weddings, job promotions, finding a quarter off the street, and such and such. I'll be perfectly honest and tell you that I don't feel the need to drink EVERY time I watch football these days. Sometimes, you'll be at a bar drinking on a Sunday afternoon watching the NFL and you'll just feel bloated and grimy. Doubly so if it's a Steelers bar. Ever hit that drinking wall at 6 p.m., when your hands are soaked in wing grease and you just wanna fucking die? It's awesome. So I'd probably take January or February. Only a fucking idiot would dare attempt the October-December gauntlet. It can't be done.

Back in the day, the president was both a head of state and also a perpetual host, entertaining dignitaries and captains of industry and all that. And what do you do when you have to host a party every night? YOU BE DRANKIN'. Nowadays, the poor bastard in office could barely have a second beer without a fucking pool report going out about it.

Doing it in the sink increases the danger of clogs, and then you'll have to take out the drain plug and pull out a 3-inch-diameter cum-soaked hairball. No one wants to deal with that kind of horror. Tell your boy to learn to use the toilet. And if he misses and nails the underside of the toilet seat, well, that's half the fun.

Big Ben would audibly fuck his gross secretary in the bathroom twice a day. And Eli would be a lousy boss because you'd look at him every day and be like, "How am I not HIS boss? That stupid asshole." Best to choose an agreeable fellow like Drew Brees, Matt Ryan, Matt Stafford, or Robert Griffin III. Or I'd choose Sanchez because I'd know I could eventually take his job.
