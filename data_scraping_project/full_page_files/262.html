  Suppose aliens came to earth and told us that they would grant us one technological improvement. The concept we choose must be at least theoretically possible (no super powers, above light speed travel, etc.), which improvement would you choose? I have heard: the cure for all diseases (cancer, AIDS, all wrapped into one); stopping the human aging gene; nuclear cold fusion; 99.9% light speed travel; and a combustion engine that runs on water. Which would you choose, and assuming this was broadcast in every language to the entire world at once, who would make the decision?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Obviously, we'd all fight over who got to make the decision and then the aliens would become disgusted with us and then rescind the offer. And then we could blame each other for fucking it all up and then the aliens would get REALLY pissed and blow up our planet altogether, which would be fantastic.
</p>
<p>
 I don't think such a decision should be placed in the hands of one person, like the president or the pope or Muhammad Ali. You could make it a web poll, but then people would either vote for the aliens to end gay marriage or vote for the aliens to get Betty White a gig hosting the Oscars or vote for realistic virtual fucking. I mean, that last one is practically a mortal lock in the hands of the general population. You'd need to have a blue-ribbon panel of scientists (who would probably take issue with what you and I deem "possible") and economists and anyone who is NOT Bono to come to a consensus on the innovation that offers the greatest advancement for human civilization. But seriously, if fucking Bono is on that panel, I will find a way to nuke the alien spaceship.
</p>
<p>
 I'm not qualified to sit on that panel either. But if there were a bureaucratic fuckup (likely) and if I were to weasel my way into the group, I wouldn't pick the aging gene

  because then I'd totally look like a hypocrite.
 </a>
 Curing all diseases also offers a similar problem due to overpopulation and lack of resources (though if obesity is on that list of "diseases," it's tempting). Here are some other choices:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; Fully functional robots, nanobots, and cyborgs
 <br/>
 &bull; Flying cars/hoverboards
 <br/>
 &bull; Wireless electricity
 <br/>
 &bull; Planet-wide climate control
 <br/>
 &bull; Virtual immortality/The Singularity (complete with virtual fucking)
 <br/>
 &bull; Ability to build functional, sustainable space colonies
 <br/>
 &bull; Time travel
 <br/>
 &bull; Energy-efficient teleportation
 <br/>
 &bull; Use of whatever space-travel technology the aliens have
 <br/>
 &bull; Ability to clone any extinct or active species/full genetic manipulation
</p>
<p>
 I'm sure I've missed a bunch, but save for teleportation (which probably isn't possible), I don't know that ANY of the above options beats out cold fusion, which SEEMS way more possible even if it probably isn't. Cold fusion solves so many problems that I get a hard-on just thinking about it: wars, global warming, gas prices, etc. It would be a miracle, as opposed to virtual fucking, which is all but inevitable anyway. I would want to pick the thing that had the widest-ranging positive effect on mankind, and something we may never be able to figure out on our own. We're gonna figure out the manufacturing and sale of fuckbots. Cold fusion isn't as close. I wonder if it'll ever happen. It's kind of our only hope.

 Stumped:

<blockquote>
 <p>
  My (largely secular) Jewish friend Matt was dating this Catholic girl and when he went with her to visit her family one weekend he had to go to Sunday mass. He had never been to a non-Jewish religious gathering and when it came time for the Eucharist he was unsure how to proceed. He decided to go ahead and take communion, even though I'm sure his Jewish grandparents would plotz if they knew, because he didn't want to offend the girl's family. What's more offensive? NOT taking communion in front of your girlfriend's family at their religious service? Or accepting the blood and body of Christ?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I was at a wedding this summer and it was an old school Catholic ceremony, the kind where they set aside a bench for the bride and groom to sit on, so you know it's gonna be a real long time before you get out of there (you feel like you really earned that first cocktail whenever you have to sit through an hour-plus ceremony). Anyway, when the time came for communion, my wife and I stood up and let the rest of our pew slide by and get into line. But we didn't bother taking communion ourselves because I didn't know if it was the right thing to do for someone who isn't a practicing Catholic. I thought hard about maybe getting in line just to see what the wafer tastes like, but chances are a communion wafer isn't gonna be made out of brown sugar and bacon fat.
</p>
<p>
 No one gave us any dirty looks when we skipped communion. Obviously, when there's a wedding, people in the church know that there are plenty of non-Catholics in attendance, which makes it different from an ordinary mass. But if your friend is clearly Jewish, I don't know that his girlfriend's family would be all that upset at him for declining to participate. If they did have a problem with it, they probably just have a problem with him being Jewish in general, in which case eating a communion wafer is gonna be way low on the list of issues. I don't think you can go wrong either way. If you decline to participate, that's fine. If you do participate, you're doing so out of respect for your host and your host's customs. It's not as if Yahweh would see you take the wafer and be like BETRAYOR! I'LL SMITE YOU GOOD! There's no wrong decision to be made. Or at least, there shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
 After the wedding, I went up to my friend, a devout Catholic who was in charge of holding the wine cup during the Eucharist, and peppered her with questions about the ritual. She told me a lot of people decline the wine because they don't want germs (she had to wipe the rim of the cup after every parishioner took a sip). She also said that there's usually a lot of wine left in the cup by the end of the ceremony, and that the priest usually drinks the rest of it because it's the blood of Christ, and you can't just dump the blood of Christ into the toilet. So now you know: If you're a priest, you get FREE wine backwash. How fucking sweet is THAT?!

 MEAT ON A STICK. Who's gonna fellate you while you're grilling? There's barely any room between you and the grill while you're poking the chicken. Anyone stationed down there is going to be subject to extreme temperatures and boiling-hot fat drippings. No one is gonna blow you for that, unless you give them first choice of chicken pieces. I spend at least 10 minutes deliberating over which piece to choose. Some of them are more perfectly browned than others. Some are bigger than others. Sometimes, I see a little piece of sizzling skin that I want, but I don't want the whole piece, so I rip that shit off and then leave the rest of the piece for some other asshole to eat.

 We also need a name for the fear of having your grill's propane tank blow up on you. Because every time I grill, I wonder if this is gonna be the day when the gas tank decides to blow the fuck up and send shards of ordnance right into my head. It will happen. My propaphobia knows this.

  What are the odds that at some point in your future you will either pick up or be handed a loaded gun, with the understanding that you will very likely need to use it against someone/something in a life or death situation? For example, the US government could collapse (MURDER IS LEGAL) leaving everyone to fight for survival in a kill-or-be-killed type of situation, there could be a zombie apocalypse, it could even be something as simple as getting the upper hand on a terrible home invader, etc. etc. It would NOT be for something like going to the firing range, or hunting, or drunkenly picking up your cop friend's handgun.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 You forgot the most obvious reason a normally placid fellow like me would turn all
 <em>
  Straw Dogs
 </em>
 on someone: any violent crime committed against my family. I mean, that's more likely than a zombie apocalypse. I spend every day in fear of a zombie war, but secretly I know it'll never happen. Much more likely that someone will break into my home and kill my loved ones, sending me into a fit of violent despair that ends only once I've picked up a rifle and stupidly tried to avenge myself, opening fire on the man responsible in a packed courtroom, missing him entirely, hitting the judge instead, and then spending the rest of my life rotting in a jail cell. I go through life knowing that little alternate reality is always sitting there, waiting for me. MAN WOULD THAT BE FUN.
</p>
<p>
 But seriously, the odds are low of any of the above occurrences ever happening. Even if the world financial system collapsed and we all became marauding packs of flesh-eaters, I'd still try to run away before I resorted to picking up a gun. I'd attempt to flee to Uruguay and spend the rest of my days tending bar and raising my children to be grouper fishermen. It wouldn't be so bad. I could see it working out.

  Have you ever considered how disgusting belts must get? Why are we putting our pants back on before we wash our hands? Surely some miniscule amount of poop bacteria must pass over or through the toilet paper to the hand. If any poop particles are being transmitted to the wiping hand, this hand then touches your zipper fly, pants button AND belt. How often does a belt get cleaned? Never? How often do you touch your belt? All the time? {head explodes}
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The only solution would be to have a Purell dispenser there in the shitter for you to use, to kill off all fecal bacteria before you touch your belt. It would serve as a kid of pre-wash for your hands. But I dunno. I use Purell a lot since I have kids around, and using Purell is disgusting. You think it'll just run into your skin right away but it doesn't. It leaves a bit of sticky film. I feel like I just washed my hands in maple syrup. Much better to just pretend your belt is perfect the way it is and not worry about it. Mine has so much FUPA sweat embedded in it that I assume the old sweat bacteria will fight off the poop bacteria on the buckle.
</p>
<p>
 I also own only one belt, and that belt has now warped to the shape of my belly. If I take it off, it actually bends because my stomach distended one side of the leather. It is ergonomically designed for my gross hairy tummy and no one else's. I would buy another belt to replace it, but have you seen how much belts cost? Twenty dollars for a fucking belt? I DON'T THINK SO, MISTER.

<p>
 I doubt it. Like a bunch of part-time mine workers from 1942 are gonna listen to some emo-banged shitheel from 2012 try to lecture them about newfangled offensive football concepts. Half the shit you'd want to do wouldn't even be legal in that era. All a defensive coordinator would have to do to stop it is point out to the ref that forward passes aren't allowed. Remember: Football coaches still ice kickers even though icing the kicker is statistically useless. The maturation process of football people is glacial, and nothing you do will be able to speed it up. And really, how much have you retained anyway? You don't really know any of the terminology. All you know is four wideout formations and shit. It would be impossible to get people to listen to you. Better to just go kill Hitler instead.

  Let's say your average, played-sports-in-high-school male in his mid-to-late 20's got the opportunity to play running back on an NFL team for one game. He gets your standard 20-30 carries (one-back system) on a team with a great O-Line, good O-coordinator, in the flow of the offense... The best possible situation. Lastly, he gets to train for six months with the team to prepare for this one game and practice with the first team the week leading up to the game. How many yards do you think he gets? Does he finish the game? Would he get killed? How many attempts before his ACLs are obliterated?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 He'd probably get injured in the practices leading up that game and then be unable to play. Even if he had the time to get in shape and prepare, he's still not in the fabled "game shape", which demands that you spend a week being thrashed with a sack full of candlesticks to adequately prepare your body for the RAW PHYSICALITY of football ZOMG SO PHYSICAL LOTS OF BODIES TOUCHING BODIES GUYS. The first hint of real contact would ruin our test subject's shit, both mentally and physically. That first jarring hit is disturbing, like being in a car accident. You feel personally violated. Also, it really hurts. If our little Papale got his hand stomped on or got a deep thigh bruise, it would begin to wear on him right away.
</p>
<p>
 If the team has a great line and a great passing game, there may be wide running lanes for him to potentially exploit. But we're talking about NFL defense here. Those holes don't stay open for very long. The Average Joe could maybe get a couple of meager gains, and perhaps withstand the punishment for a little bit thanks to extensive padding and a dozen cortisone shots. Conceivably, he could finish the game a staggering wreck, not blatantly injured but clearly banged up everywhere. I can't possibly see him gaining more than a dozen total yards. In other words, he's Chris Johnson.

So it's satisfying to find your power cord in the nick of time and deny your phone the chance to shut down on you and fuck you over.
