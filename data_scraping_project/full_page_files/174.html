  What current athlete would make the best Batman? Is there
also an athlete archetype that may tend to fit better?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 You have to pick a UFC fighter because Batman's primary job
is to disarm criminals, beat the shit out of them, and then brood all day about
the scourge of evil in the world and how no one man can stop it all, nor can that
one man fill the hole left in his heart with sweet vengeance (wahhhhh wahhhhh).  As good as LeBron James is at basketball,
it's not like he's specifically trained for that sort of thing.  You need someone who is lean and compact and
sturdy and can fit into tight suits and Batjets easily.  So it's much better to go with Cain Velasquez
or some other MMA hotshot that can put the Joker in an arm bar and wrest away
the detonation remote.
</p>
<p>
 But picking a fighter is an easy answer.  If we're going strictly by athletes from the
big four sports, I'm picking an NFL linebacker or safety, specifically one
trained in the martial arts (like Clay Matthews, for example).  They're less bulky than linemen, and they
have a taste for blood!  You need Batman
to be PHYSICAL.  I'd take Matthews or
LaRon Landry over some dipshit baseball player, no matter how good a pitcher
might be with a Batarang.  I'm not entrusting
the Batsuit to some country music-listening hayseed.

  Should the Eagles/Packers have let the Saints/49ers score a
touchdown with 2 minutes left? It was their only hope.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well, that assumes that the Niners and/or Eagles would
comply and score with time left, and both of those teams are probably too smart
to ever fall for it.  The Packers/Eagles
would have had to hope that someone on the other team would pull an Ahmad
Bradshaw and score on impulse.  It's
easier to get a team to do this at the goal line&mdash;with a touchdown so close
by&mdash;than from the 14-yard-line, which is where the Saints made their game
winning kick.  If you lie down on the 14
and let Mark Ingram through, he's probably got enough time to figure out what
kinda shit you're trying to pull.  It may
be your only hope, but it can also make the outcome even more assured.
</p>
<p>
 In the case of the Packers, you saw how close Davon House
was to blocking that kick (even if he was offside).  In the frigid weather, I'd take my chances on
a botched snap or hold rather than try to trick Frank Gore into scoring.  You're losing either way.

 <p>
  What exactly constitutes a bandwagon fan?  Is it the
lack of physical proximity to the team?  Is it the amount of time one has
rooted for a particular team in relation to the team's success?  Or is it
the number of times the fan has gone to see the team play?  For the
record, I am writing this record to see if I fall into the bandwagon
category.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think that the average bandwagon fan is defined as someone
who only takes an interest in a team when that team has a good chance of
winning it all, and someone who will not admit to this fact.  You can start out as a bandwagon fan and then
turn into a legit fan.  For example, I
think a lot of younger Cowboys fans started out rooting for the team in 1990s,
when they were winning titles, and then stuck with the team as it spiraled down
into hilarious mediocrity over the past two decades.  Even if you aren't from Dallas and you
started out as a bandwagon fan, if you've watched every game since then and
stuck with the team, your fandom is now legit. 
You're a TERRIBLE person, but I won't question your fan cred.
</p>
<p>
 People choose their favorite team for various reasons, and
dominance during their childhood is one of them.  The origins of your fandom don't necessarily
make you a bandwagoner for life; it's what you do afterward that earns you the
brand.  If you flit between teams
depending upon whether or not they're winning, you're a bandwagon fan (and
probably a famous actor or hip hop artist). 
If you're a suburban mom who only talks to their kids about sports when
the local team happens to be making a run, you're a bandwagon fan.  If you decided that you love the Miami Heat
just when they happened to acquire LeBron, and you pretend like you were always
a fan of them, you're a bandwagon fan.  Those
are the people who deserve to be spat upon and ridiculed.  Those are the people trying to conveniently
mooch off a bit of title glory for themselves. 
We want fans to EARN their happiness. 
We don't want them cutting in at the last second to hoist the trophy.
</p>
<p>
 This is why Yankees fans get shit on so often.  People who move to New York become
self-appointed New Yorkers very quickly (almost by necessity&mdash;you have delude
yourself into loving New York to tolerate living there), and adopting the
Yankees is often part of that transformation. 
God, they're fucking terrible people.

  What happens if someone murders one of President Obama's

Terrorism?

</blockquote>
<p>
 I don't think you can technically charge Bo's assassin with
murder.  But if we're talking about the
President's dog, you can rest assured that Federal prosecutors would charge the
killer with every feasible crime: animal cruelty, possession of a firearm,
illegal discharging of a firearm, conspiracy, terrorism, attempted murder of
the president himself (if he happens to be nearby), disturbing the peace, etc.  And a judge will throw down the maximum
sentence and/or fine in every instance. 
When the feds want to throw the book at you, rest assured they will find
a way.  That's how it works.  They tailor their charges to how big of a cock
you are.
</p>
<p>
 In DC, cruelty to animals "resulting in serious bodily
injury or death is a Felony with a fine of up to $25,000 and/or imprisonment up
to 5 years."  No way Bo's killer
gets only five years.  The general public
would want that fucker's head on a stick. 
A little creative prosecuting and BOOM! 
Life sentence for animal racketeering or something.

 Ian:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  What if every field goal taken from inside the 35-yard line
HAS to be kicked from the 35? A fifty yard field goal is still from fifty
yards, but a kick from the 15 has to be moved back twenty yards. A forty-five
yard field goal isn't insanely more difficult, but it's enough to make it more
interesting.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It is more interesting&mdash;it probably would have forced the
Niners to go for the touchdown on Sunday night&mdash;but it's inherently unfair.  The reward for getting your team closer to
the goal line is that field goals get progressively easier, and it
 <em>
  should
 </em>
 be that way.  A team that advances to the ten deserves a
shorter field goal that some dipshit offense that can't even make it to the red
zone.  So I can't go with you on this.  If you want a kickass rule change to
football, it's gotta be rational.  For
example, if you made every PAT from the 35-yard-line, now we're talking.  I fucking hate the PAT.

 <p>
  My wife and I have an 11-week-old, and we rarely eat dinner
together on account of one of us is is always feeding, changing, cleaning,
burping, tending to the baby.  Last night, my wife finishes her meal, and
tells me to use the same plate she used (I guess to save room in the
dishwasher?), to which I promptly replied, "No, that's gross".
 She informed me know that we made a baby together, and I'm being
immature. Naturally, I respond "Farts and Boobies!"  Now we were
eating lasagna that night, and her plate looked like a bunnies were slaughtered
on it, very messy. Am I wrong?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Whatever floats your boat. 
Personally, I would have just eaten off my old lady's plate to prevent
dishwasher crowding.  At the end of the
night, these goddamn kids have gone through so many plates and cups and spoons
that the dishwasher is ready to suffer an inguinal hernia.  It's more crowded than a fucking nightclub in
there.  I have to muscle plates into one
another just to get one last cup to fit. 
So one plate less can make the difference between winning and losing.
</p>
<p>
 But I'm extremely lax about foods touching each other.  My old lady will eat some lasagna and then
have salad on a separate salad plate, like civilized folk.  Not me. 
I dump that salad right onto the lasagna bits.  Helps sop up the last of the ricotta
dingleberries sitting there.  MMMM...
LASAGNA SALAD.

 By the way, I went to a

class once
 </a>
 and 90% of the questions asked by my classmates revolved around
eating.  When you're a single person, you
think nothing about eating.  Seems
easy.  You sit down.  You eat. 
There you go.  One of the hardest
things to adjust to as a parent is how fucking HARD kids make eating.  They eat nothing.  They never stay seated.  They piss and moan about everything.  It's AWFUL. 
There are nights when my wife will start crying because dinner has been
such a fucking train wreck.  It's
stressful, and we're talking about EATING! 
One of the easiest, most pleasurable human experiences.  Anyway, my teacher said that you should never
expect kids to sit for long at the dinner table.  And I've tried to accept that.  But man, when your kids have eaten and
excused themselves before you've even had a chance to salt your food, it makes
you so, so pissed.

  Let's say the team you root for is on the road that week and
you decide to go to the game. Also, you choose to go shirtless with your entire
upper body painted your team's colors. You are the only one doing so, by the
way. Before halftime your team is getting crushed with no chance of coming back
and you look ridiculous. Do you stick it out for the rest of the game with
no shirt looking like an idiot or do you puss out and put your shirt back on
only to be ridiculed even more by the home team fans?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 There's no chance you put your shirt back on.  You either stick it out (likely because you
are drunk and shameless anyway), or you leave. 
This is why very few people paint their bodies alone.  You almost always do this with a group.  It's a protective measure.  If you win, it looks festive.  If you get crushed, you can at least goof on
each other for the rest of the game about what a disaster it turned out to be.

bodies for an upcoming hockey game, and they asked if I wanted to do it with
them.  I said yes, of course.  They told me I was gonna be the "C"
in COLBY and that I should meet them at the rink with the C already painted on
my belly (Any other sane person would have been tipped off immediately at this
point, but I was desperate to be liked). 
So I go to my room.  I draw a big
C on my chest and belly, I go to the arena, find my friends, take my shirt
off... and I was the only one to paint myself. 
Let me tell you something: You will never be more self-conscious than
when you are the only half-naked person in a crowd.  Even if you're drunk.  You gotta be REAL confident to pull that
off.  I was not.  I fled the arena.  College can be so cruel.

  In a future where cloning is legal, do you think the NFL
would allow clones to play? Do you think they would allow clones on the same team?
For example you could have two active Peyton Mannings on your roster so your
quarterback position would always be fresh and healthy. Or imagine having four
Calvin Johnson's lined up wide. Whoa.

</blockquote>
<p>
 If it were legal in society, then I think it would be legal
in football.  I don't see why not.  It would be worth it just for the HOT SPORTS
TAKES from the likes of Rick Reilly and Skippy Bayless.  "Clones? 
More like
 <em>

 !"  That joke would be used.
</p>
<p>
 But I think the NFL would probably drag its feet before
finally coming around.  After all, weed
is now legal in two states, but the major sports leagues have yet to formally
allow athletes to smoke it.  There's
going to be an inevitable lag because the NFL never misses a chance to seize
the moral high ground.  But trust me: In
the future, when it turns out that playing one down of football gives you inoperable
brain tumors and the talent pool has dried up due to class action litigation,
they'll have no choice but to use clones anyway.
</p>
<p>
 In fact, I could see NFL teams starting up clone farms,
birthing players in test tubes and breeding them like KFC chickens for the explicit
purpose of making them into interchangeable position players.  I have no problem with this.  It's well worth ceding our inherent humanity
in order to create 22 "twins" of Calvin Johnson and then forcing
them to battle for my amusement.  And the
best part is... if one gets injured, another equally good one is right behind
them!  SAME MAN UP.  The talent would be so plentiful, we wouldn't
even have to pay the players.  We could
simply house them in barns and keep them tethered to perpetual treadmills.  Jerry Richardson masturbates to this idea at
night.

 Nah, you're just doing what you want, which is always the

lamer, and apparently this happens whether you have kids or not, which is of
great comfort to me, since I've been berating my kids for eight years about
ruining my social life (it helps build character in them).  The key to getting older is ACCEPTING your
lameness, which then makes you cool!  I
don't go to nightclubs because I'm old and don't have time and because
nightclubs are fucking awful.  In other
words, I AM TOO FUCKING COOL FOR THE NIGHTCLUB. 
One of the joys of getting older is driving past a line outside a bar or

  I'm currently in three fantasy leagues, but how many leagues

<p>
 I think three is a bad number.  You need to be in either one league, two
leagues, or 90.  I know people who have
a dozen fantasy teams or more and once you get to that number, you treat
fantasy players like stocks because you will simultaneously start and play
against your players virtually every week anyway.  So you start picking which players to invest
heavily in and which to purge from your portfolio, and you root for the players
you have on more of your teams.  Even
then, I don't really know how those guys manage to stay sane with a zillion
rosters to manage.

<p>
 I've been in two leagues for a few years now, and next year
I'm going down to one.  I am sick to
death of ALWAYS having both my fantasy games somehow boil down to me rooting
for Demaryius Thomas to score over 10 points (because I have him in one
league) but not MORE than 14 points (because I'm playing against him in
the other league).  I fucking hate
it.  If there is a way for fantasy
football to annoy you, it will.  I can't
handle two leagues anymore.  And I never
fucking win anyway.

  What if every NCAA athlete (I'm talking every football
player, basketball player, swimmer, fencer, golfer, bowler, gymnast, volleyball

teacher or coach or sponsor or uncle or whomever and then all self-reported
their 'violation' to the NCAA?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The NCAA would just slap them all on the wrist.  For all its petty statutes and bureaucratic
anal probes, the NCAA tailors punishments to its own benefit.  This is why no school has gotten the death
penalty since SMU&mdash;because the NCAA realized that shutting down a program did
the Association more harm than good.  They
can let Auburn and Cam Newton's dad skate by if they don't want Bowl money
jeopardized.  Or they can make like the
Feds and try to throw the book at Penn State when it's already down.  There are no moral decisions made at the
NCAA, even though they would like people to believe that every decision they
make is made by a wise panel of consisting of twenty iterations of the ghost of
John Wooden.
</p>
<p>
 So if all the college athletes decided to break NCAA rules
en masse (good luck getting college kids to do anything simultaneously that
doesn't involve binge drinking or humping), the NCAA would tut-tut to Charles
Robinson, wait for a bit, and then send a stern "Okay you get a
warning" letter to every student.  And
if they did it again?  Second warning,

subside as your kids get older?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Not really.  Sometimes
I'll take out my phone when I'm hanging with my kids because pushing a Thomas
train around a track gets really tiring after just two spins, and after three
seconds I'll feel like shit for having the phone out, so I put it away and then
take it out again when I'm bored two minutes later.  And so the cycle goes.  One time, my kid actually asked me to put my
phone away and I felt like the worst parent on Earth.  So I put the phone away.  And then took it out again.  And I imagine that, one of these days, I'll
whip that stupid fucking phone out and the kid will write me off for good and
my failure as a father will be complete. 
I don't know if that's true, but I can picture it.
</p>
<p>
 It's a strange phenomenon with parenting.  There are times when I can't wait to get my
kids to sleep or get them to school, so that I can have time to fart around as
I please.  ME ME ME.  And then, once I've finally rid myself of
them, I feel terribly lonely.  This is
especially true on business trips.  I
took a trip to San Diego once and had a free night to myself.  This was during ComicCon, so there were giant
hordes of people teeming about and talking and drinking and all that (ComicCon
nerds are an unexpectedly social bunch), and I was by myself, walking the
streets.  And I'm telling you: I had no
idea what to do with myself.  I went to a
bar and had a drink by myself and felt like a fucking loser, which is saying a
lot when there are "Chuck" fanboys milling about.  Then I just wandered around aimlessly like a
crazy person.  I think I had an ice cream
sundae for dinner.  The idea that my
family was asleep and thousands of miles away nearly made me have a nervous
breakdown.  The co-dependence is
STAGGERING.  I want time for myself, but
there is no me without the rest of my family around.  When I go away on trips, I feel like part of
a toy that got lost behind the couch. 
I'm useless.

 So no, the guilt never goes away.  But it does mean that you care, which is
good.  The guilt lets you know it's

  I injured my shoulder pretty seriously playing rugby over

worse.  I finally bit the bullet and scheduled an appointment with an
orthopedic doctor.  The earliest they could get me in was two weeks
out.  I am convinced/terrified that my shoulder is going to magically
heal between now and then, and when I show up for the appointment the doctor
will find nothing wrong and think I am a faker/giant wimp.

 <p>
  My dream scenario is that it turns out to be the worst
shoulder tear he has ever seen, so that I look like a WARRIOR for playing out
our last few games of the season through such a devastating injury.  To
