      "<p>Before we get down into the guts of the Funbag, some very dry and tedious busywork: First, I got a <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/DrewMagary/archive\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter</a> now, because making people sign up for spam is the hot new thing in tech.

      "<p>I can’t pick a bank, right? Because banks and jewelry stores are the obvious answer. If we’re talking strictly about loading up on cool shit, my answer is Bass Pro Shops. You can steal a whole boat AND an ATV! Shit, I’d also loot the taxidermied animals. I’d grab a whole stuffed grizzly bear and park him right next to my front door. Then I’d hide behind it and people would walk into the house and I’d lean the bear in and go GRRRRRRRR! and they’d shit their pants. Tell me that wouldn’t be a good time. YOU CANNOT.</p>\n",
      "<p>I went to a Bass Pro Shop (do you keep it plural if you’re just talking about one of them? Is OUTDOOR WORLD just the store’s sub-name?) for the first time this spring, and immediately felt like I had wasted my life up until that point. My wife saw the look on my face and was like, “Oh shit, we’ve opened Pandora’s Box.” At any moment now I could pull a <em>Mosquito Coast</em> and load up on nature supplies and uproot my family and force them to live off the SEA.</p>\n",
      "<p>Anyway, that store has all the good dad shit: boats, fishing rods, guns, more guns, trucker hats, beef jerky, EVERYTHING. And they had a sit-down restaurant (I ordered alligator nuggets, which came with a small tub of disturbingly green mayonnaise… only bad part of my visit). Plus it looks like a big mountain lodge. I’ve always wanted to live in a mountain lodge, with all the wooden rafters and what not. I would steal the WHOLE shop and make it my house. I want a lodge on a lake and I want a bearskin rug for fucking on. If the Zombie Apocalypse comes, I’m barricading myself that store and not a Walmart. Frankly, I’m looking forward to it.</p>\n",

      "<p>I say this is only okay if you start off rooting just for players and not teams. It is NOT okay if you start out as a fan of one team, and then ditch that team just because your favorite player bolted. You know exactly which kind of fans I’m talking about: Favre and Peyton fanboys. Those people are vile scum, and they should be ridiculed to the grave for donning half-and-half jerseys. You have to be team-agnostic to become a player-only fanboy.</p>\n",
      "<p>By the way, it’s perfectly acceptable to go in reverse and choose a team for life BECAUSE your favorite player is on it. That’s how 85 percent of kids end up picking their team and that’s established practice. You start off loving the player, and then the team gets its hooks into you, and then your favorite player leaves for the goddamn Patriots and you are stuck with some loser franchise for life. That’s the proper way of going about things.</p>\n",

      "<p>If a basketball was physically capable of jumping from the three point line and dunking the ball, would that count as a 3?</p>\n",
      "<p> Yeah, of course. It’s all about where your feet are positioned before you take the shot. So if some enterprising young player decides to HACK THE MAINFRAME by implanting rocket boosters inside his rectum and dunking from beyond the arc, that’s a legit three. I mean, apart from the illegal rocket booster part.</p>\n",
      "<p> I gotta tell you I find it hilarious that there’s been an entire basketball revolution around teams getting together and being like, “Hey, what if we got better at shooting three pointers?” Like, there was nothing stopping them before from doing just that. And it’s not like the ‘80s and ‘90s were bereft of good shooters. Teams had Dennis Scott and Reggie Miller and the rest. Yet I distinctly remember that taking a three-pointer was considered risky and players that took a lot of threes were selfish GLORY BOYS. Teams had one three-point specialist and they would only let him shoot if they executed a series of nine different screens and picks to get him free. And when teams did build around the three, it was like DURRR THAT’S A GIMMICK OFFENSE IT’LL NEVER LAST DURRR.</p>\n",
      "<p>Then Rick Pitino came along and was like, “Oh wow, these shots are worth one extra point. Let’s try to make more of those,” and they DID. Then pro teams crunched the numbers and now it’s like a revolution even those three-pointers were always there. Maybe these guys CAN dunk from beyond the three, they just haven’t tried it yet. I like it when teams decide to be awesome at awesome things.</p>\n",

      "<p>The driving part of parenting only gets worse as the kids get older, by the way. Since all of my kids are now out of preschool (no diapers, no strollers, no bottles, etc.), I kinda thought I had it made. But no, driving FUCKS you. I had to pick my kid up from a party on a Saturday and the party ran till 11. That meant I couldn’t booze and had to get into the car at 10:45 to go get her. And while I was driving, I was like, “Oh shit, it’s gonna be like this for ALL of middle school.” It’s just gonna be me chauffeuring the kids around to sports and birthday parties and even movies. Fucking hell. I gotta teach these kids how to use Uber. I see no danger in it.</p>\n",
      "<p>And the logistics of driving are even worse than the actual dirving. Every fucking weekend, it’s like trying to solve a goddamn riddle. <em>Child A needs to be soccer at 11 a.m. but Child B needs to be at gymnastics at noon but there’s ALSO a birthday party for Child C at the same time, followed by a communion potluck at 2:15 p.m. Who’s gonna take which car? You can’t take the sedan because it doesn’t have the car seat in it, UNLESS you change the car seat. Hmm. Oh, but then you’ll have to take the potato salad with you and that might spoil! So what if you drop Child B off then come BACK home and drown yourself?</em>  It’s awful, and I swear to God it’s a daily occurrence. Logistics should be outlawed.</p>\n",
      "<p>So I understand the parental urge to just cancel all plans and just do nothing. But you know what? I’ve had empty days for these kids, and the charm wears off roughly but 9:15 a.m. By that time, I’m willing to drive the fuckers anywhere.

If it were up to BIG BOOSTER SEAT and your pediatrician, your kid would be in a rear-facing Britax seat until age 36. Worse yet, they’ve conditioned many parents to also believe this.

I mean sure, the airbag could deploy and kill your child, but you should live for the danger once in a while, you know? I promise you that you will make every single car seat transition a bit sooner than is formally recommended, and you will feel like shit about it.

That thrill of discovery is the same regardless of generation, and I’d rather grow up with an ever-expanding back catalog of pop culture that’s been fully digitized and easily accessible than go back to the stone ages, where you had to wait in line outside a fucking Dayton’s for three hours just to get Def Leppard tickets.</p>\n",

      "<p>Also, I don’t wanna flinch every time I look up at the TV. That baseball is going 90 mph. What if it comes through the TV and hits me in the nutsack? No thank you. I’m not a professional hitter. I’m not gonna be able to glean what kind of pitch it was if I’m watching it delivered to the plate in real time. I can “see” the pitch much better if I’m behind the pitcher and at a greater remove, and even then I usually need the announcer to tell me what kind of pitch it was after the fact. Oh, so that was a cutter? How did the color guy know that so quickly? He must be a wizard!</p>\n",

      "<p>Yeah I don’t fuck with day drinking, for the most part. It’s the only thing keeping me from being a hopeless lush. I wait the day out, and THEN destroy myself. That’s the healthy way of doing business.</p>\n",
      "<p>Day drinking is fun once in a while, like when you’re at the beach and you know that your day is wide open and you can nap most of the afternoon. And it’s fun to be drunk at a time when less fortunate people still have to run around doing lots of tedious horseshit. Not you! No, you’re all lit up and strolling around without a care. It’s a fantastic feeling. That’s when day drinking makes the most sense. It does NOT make sense if you have commitments later on—ballet recitals, work, court dates—that will be MISERABLE to experience while nursing a pre-hangover. Unless you are a full-fledged alcoholic who doesn’t even register the buzz of alcohol anymore, you will pay dearly for the sordid thrill of cracking open a beer at lunchtime. I would rather be productive during the day and then overly reward myself for it once 5 p.m. hits.</p>\n",
      "<p>I’m also gonna confess here that I don’t understand brunch drinking at all. If I’m hungover on a Sunday morning, the last thing I wanna do is go to some packed New York diner and drink boozy tomato juice. Nothing about that strikes me as restorative. Gimme a recliner, a blanket, some Advil and a cup of tea instead.</p>\n",

He spent the whole day in the hot sun moving boxes, unpacking, etc. She treated him to a meal of pizza and wings, classic movers food.</p><p>An hour into his drive home, he starts to feel the unmistakable rumble of wing shits. Heat + Sweat + Wings + Beer + Time = Trouble. He’s on a wooded country road, very few cars in sight, so at first he decides he’ll start speeding to try to make it home. Then he realizes an hour is much too long to hold this enemy at bay.

He lays this down on the seat to protect it from the obvious danger.</p><p>When he’s back in the car for another half hour, the rumbles come knocking again. Committed to NOT reliving his recent past, he starts to speed, thinking he can hold it at bay. He gets about 15 minutes from home and another car appears on the horizon.</p><p>This car has sirens.
