 I don&rsquo;t know what the fine print is on the contract George Lucas signed with Disney, but I would assume that $4 billion bought the

 full control of pretty much everything, much to Lucas&rsquo;s chagrin. They can do whatever they want now, old man! SUCK IT! Watch them slit Jar Jar&rsquo;s throat in front of your grandchildren just to make them cry! YOU CANNOT STOP IT.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, Disney could probably remake the prequels if they wanted to, which they SHOULD. I know it&rsquo;s not a priority right now, because they&rsquo;re making the new trilogy (plus the spinoff movies and TV shows and webisodes and puppet documentaries), but they&rsquo;ve already proven they can make a
 <em>
  Star Wars
 </em>
 movie that looks and feels and sounds like the old classics: weird creatures in homemade costumes, beat-up spaceships, villains with cool voices, dialogue I like reciting to myself while taking a shit, etc. The prequels lacked all of those things, and their continued existence dilutes the LEGACY OF THE SERIES, which is super important to people like me who have ZERO perspective in life. Also, the fact that prequel shit still infects
 <em>
  Star Wars
 </em>
 merch and books and toys cannot stand. I would like all traces of Naboo obliterated with a literal Starkiller death ray.
</p>
<p>
 So, somewhere down the line, Disney should (if they haven&rsquo;t already) make a plan to reboot the prequels and erase the old ones from history. What if Anakin Skywalker were actually played by TOM MOTHERFUCKING HARDY, and instead of being a whiny dipshit pod-racing bro, he was actually a Jedi Academy bully who sabered little Jedi boys for their power converter money? KABOOM. Another billion dollars. Someone get the Coen brothers to write that shit.
</p>
<p>
 (By the way, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of people out there bitching that the new movie is too much like the first
 <em>
  Star Wars
 </em>
 movie, which is amusing, because the first
 <em>
  Star Wars
 </em>
 movie itself took its plot from

 <em>
  Star Wars
 </em>
 , where all I really give a shit about is the look and the dialogue and the characters. They nailed ALL of that, and that&rsquo;s no small feat. So bitch all you want for some magical unicorn movie out there that borrows from nothing at all. It doesn&rsquo;t exist.)

 <p>
  Are calzones underrated? Because I think they are seriously underappreciated.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 No, I think calzones are exactly where they oughta be in the Italian food hierarchy. They exist mainly as the occasional change-up from pizza. Aesthetically, I also enjoy that a calzone is larger than a standard slice of pizza, because my goal is to put as much food inside of my body as quickly as possible. When I was in boarding school (I know, I know), I used to order a pepperoni calzone for dinner every Sunday night. This thing came in a box that was already soaked in grease, and had a two-inch layer of hot pepperoni slices inside. They also put cheese on TOP of the calzone, as if the cheese inside was insufficient. It was the single most evil thing I&rsquo;ve ever eaten, and it was fantastic.
</p>
<p>
 But when push comes to shove, I prefer pizza. A calzone is essentially a big dough bag filled with pizza crap. It&rsquo;s very thick, and it can get very soggy. And if you get a bad one, it&rsquo;s like eating a deep dish pizza where you realize you have a thick wad of cheese in your mouth and you feel disgusted with yourself. With pizza, every bite gives you the perfect proportion of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings. Plus the crust is crispier, and I ALWAYS require my dish have a textural element. Oh! And the toppings get charred, too! Like when the pepperoni gets cooked real good and the edges kind of curl up? God, I love that. Sometimes my kid won&rsquo;t eat her pepperoni and she&rsquo;ll pick it off, and I gather it all up in my big fat fist and eat it in a single bite. ECSTASY.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, now I want a calzone stuffed WITH a whole pizza.

  Mike Pettine was actually the only guy on Earth who wanted to accept that job during the last Browns head coaching search/circus. What would the NFL do with the Browns if they couldn&rsquo;t find a single guy to accept that job?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 LANE KIFFIN. Seriously though, they&rsquo;ll find a poor schmuck to take that job. The money is good, and every coach likes to have &ldquo;head coach&rdquo; on a resume somewhere, even if that head coaching stint was a disaster (all of the New Browns former head coaches are gainfully employed elsewhere, and Pettine will be, too). The coaching community is insular and filled with disgusting cronyism. So even if you lead Cleveland to an 0-32 record over two seasons, some other coach will be like, &ldquo;Hey, he was a head coach once! And Coach Blorp says he&rsquo;s good with recruiting!&rdquo; At that high of a level, no job is a career-killer.
</p>
<p>
 Also, coaches are egomaniacal lunatics who ALWAYS fantasize about turning around some moribund shitwreck of a team. If you automatically knew your next season as a head coach would result in a Super Bowl, would you rather bring a title to some spoiled town like Dallas, or to Cleveland? Every coach wants to be a savior.
</p>
<p>
 Even if literally every last man turned the job down, the team could just turn to some current employee and foist the job on him, Jim Zorn-style. Or Roger Goodell could cash in some favor and force some lackey to do it. &ldquo;Dave, I saw you eat that pizza during our meeting and didn&rsquo;t punish you for it. NOW YOU MUST COACH BARKEVIOUS MINGO.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s always somebody.
</p>
<p>
 (By the way, I still can&rsquo;t believe Al Davis hired a college
 <em>
  assistant
 </em>
 as his coach and then acted surprised when it all went to shit. Of all the desperate head coaching hires made throughout NFL history&mdash;jobs no one else wanted&mdash;Al made, like, six of them. Jimmy Haslam still has some catching up to do.)

 <p>
  Why are offensive/defensive pass interference rules thrown out the window on Hail Mary passes? It seems like it&rsquo;s nothing but interference inside the clusterfuck that forms in the end zone. Is it because it&rsquo;s just impossible for the refs to call accurately? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like that there&rsquo;s no call and that it&rsquo;s just a free-for-all, but it&rsquo;s odd that the rules are so inflexible any other time but then.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s never called on a Hail Mary because everyone is going for the ball, which is legal. The average PI penalty comes when the defensive back has his head turned around and you&rsquo;re screaming TURN YOUR HEAD AROUND YOU DUMB FUCK at him, but he won&rsquo;t, and then the ref throws the flag at his nuts for being an idiot. On a Hail Mary, everyone is already way down the field, so defenders don&rsquo;t have to look back while the ball is in the air. If you&rsquo;re a ref calling PI on that play, it better be because the safety tore a guy&rsquo;s a helmet off and carved both of his eyes out.

 So if Trump died tomorrow, I would have to fly to James Woods&rsquo; house and beg him to run in his stead. We will never have a normal election again if I can help it. In 2020, we&rsquo;re gonna need Trump&rsquo;s kid, Chet Haze, Steve Harvey, Bob Knight, AND the Phillie Phanatic to all run.

 It&rsquo;s 5 a.m. You can begin a day at 5 a.m., and many people do, either because they have a plane to catch, or because they have to do it for work, or because of kids, or because they&rsquo;re fucking crazy. You can get up at five, and then, with enough coffee, make it through to the end of the day. But earlier than five? Fuck that. That&rsquo;s the dead of night. That&rsquo;s when waking up is completely unreasonable, and no one has begun to do anything yet. If you get up before five, your entire focus as a person will be on going back to sleep at some point, preferably sooner rather than later. If I were president, my priority would be making sure no American has to get up that early for any reason. At 4 a.m., any alarm going off is an act of war.

 No coach could let that stand. He would have to find the dumper and cut him on the spot (unless the dumper was Odell Beckham). Skip Bayless would spend eight months lobbying for your lifetime ban from the sport if you did that.
</p>
<p>
 I have to think that some coach out there&mdash;let&rsquo;s call him Sick Naban&mdash;has already instituted a formal NO GATORADE BATH policy that results in instant scholarship revocation and naked titty pictures of your girlfriend sent to pro scouts. And I bet that ban makes players even MORE determined to nail Sick Naban with a jug full of half-Gatorade, half-urine.

 Candy is just candy. You can have it for dessert, but that&rsquo;s not terribly satisfying. For a proper dessert, I need a plate or bowl of poisonous garbage: ice cream, pie, apple brown betty, etc. And then I have candy AFTER that. Candy is the apr&egrave;s dessert.

  This old article
 </a>
 from the
 <em>
  National Football Post
 </em>
 goes into detail about how scouts are badly underpaid and how NFL teams, on average, don&rsquo;t spend as much on scouting as they ought to. The most famous recent example, of course, was the Bengals, who didn&rsquo;t even HAVE a scouting department until Marvin Lewis begged them for one. Before that, Mike Brown used to just go through head shots while eating cold cherry pie. So any team that beefs up on scouting infrastructure is probably making a very wise, cost-effective move.
</p>
<p>
 HOWEVER, you can&rsquo;t have an endless number of scouts, because, at the end of the process, one guy is still gonna have to make the call on who to draft or sign, and he can&rsquo;t have 75 different highly paid assholes giving him 75 different opinions with about 1,000 different players to choose from. You need some measure of efficiency, regardless of whatever business you&rsquo;re in. Otherwise, you get too many cooks, etc. Also, your best guys would still leave to go to some other team just so they could be the big swinging dick who has more influence in taking Derrick Henry off the draft board. HE&rsquo;S A SYSTEM PLAYER, GUYS! NOT THE RIGHT FIT FOR OUR BALLCLUB. Football people like getting paid, but they like being The Man even more.

 You can&rsquo;t take that away from captains. Why even BE a captain otherwise? The best part of captaining is going out for the coin toss and sticking your chest out and feeling all cool because you are a leader of men and having the crowd know it. Girls in the stands look at you and are like, &ldquo;Whoa, he&rsquo;s the captain! That&rsquo;s way hot.&rdquo; Or so I would assume. Can&rsquo;t put a price on that. I would have shit hot knives to be a football team captain back in the day just so I could walk out for that coin flip. You can&rsquo;t take that away from players, even if players are morons, and passing vital information through them is riskier than jumping off a tall bridge.

<p>
 Oh, forever. Saying NO is what makes a child flagrantly disobey and stick his hand in a blender anyway. Parenting magazines specifically instruct you to avoid saying NO to a kid (mostly because they learn to say NO right back). So instead of saying, &ldquo;NO PUNCHING,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;How about we do this jigsaw puzzle instead?&rdquo; And instead of saying, &ldquo;NO YOU CAN&rsquo;T EAT THAT BAG OF NAILS,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s enjoy a lovely mango smoothie!&rdquo; Please note that none of these alternatives work.
</p>
<p>
 Most everything your child learns from you is nonverbal. They learn to avoid jumping into fire because YOU avoid it. They obey traffic lights because YOU obey them. Any words on top of that mean virtually nothing. During the course of any given day, I will lecture my kids about not pissing in the driveway, and then my wife will tell me I&rsquo;m using too many words, and then I get mad at HER for correcting me in front of the children, and then I stammer off angrily. Works pretty well!

 I keep them in the package the whole time, because they protect the rest of the bread from getting stale. If you take the heels out right away, the new end pieces go stale more quickly.

 I think you can put mushrooms and olives on it, too, which is why I never order a supreme pizza. The risk of olives is way too high. I always order the SUPER MEAT pizza instead, because it&rsquo;s like a supreme pizza, but with all meat. Black olives are disgusting, and anytime someone bites into a slice of pizza littered with miniature olive tires, I am at a loss. When a mass pizza order is filed, someone always orders either a veggie pizza (why) or a supreme pizza, and neither one ever gets eaten. You should order a few plain pizzas, a few pepperoni pizzas, one or two sausage and mushroom pizzas, and that&rsquo;s it. You don&rsquo;t need any niche-market pizzas.
