 Before I get to the Funbag, a quick programming note: There
WILL be a Jamboroo column on Thanksgiving. 
It should run early before the games start.  So be on the lookout for that while your mom
makes you spoon cranberry sauce out of a can because she doesn't trust you with
the important cooking duties.

  I read your article about
  <a href="http://deadsp.in/i7MsnJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   being a transfer student
  </a>
  . Much like you were, I'm struggling socially and haven't
been able to make friends. I know you said you didn't have a much better
experience at your next school, but would you recommend transferring anyway?
It's what I want to do, but my parents want me to stick it out because of the
academic merits of the school I'm currently at.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I can only speak from personal experience, but I don't
regret transferring.  It didn't do
wonders for my social life, but that's on me. 
At least I ended up at a school that was a much better fit for me in
other ways: size, proximity to home and friends at other schools, etc.  I thought I was ready for some bigass rah-rah
school but the truth was that I was immature and still needed the nurturing
environs of some isolated dipshit liberal arts joint.
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes you have an idea of what you want out of a college
while you're touring around and perusing all the course catalogs ("They have a
class on Tarantino!") and reading
 <em>
  The Insider's Guide to Colleges
 </em>
 (my parents
had a copy of this and I eyebanged the social life rankings intensely) and that
vision of what you want for a school ends up being at complete odds with what you
actually need, because 18-year-olds are poor arbiters of such things.  Every high school senior thinks he can make
a good decision about where to go to school but that's complete horseshit.  He'll pick a $50K per year place just
because he saw a hot chick on the quad steps.
</p>
<p>
 If money allows it, I would recommend transferring if you really
feel as if you've made a terrible mistake, as if there's nothing you could do
personally to improve your quality of life where you are.  It's not a cure-all.  You will probably struggle to make friends at
the new place, perhaps even more so because you're new.  But maybe the change in environment will give
you a fresh attitude or plunk you down in a city where you can make friends
outside of school or what have you.  Or
maybe you'll find a girlfriend.  It's no
guarantee.  My brother-in-law transferred
two, possibly even three times before finally graduating from a school
nearby.  That's just how shit goes
sometimes, but it's always worth making the effort to extract yourself from
what you know is a hopeless situation.
</p>
<p>
 Just don't transfer to Duke.

<p>
 There are always bookies around willing to take bets on
anything you're stupid enough to bet on. 
Even if you bet $1,000 on a nip slip or something, I assure you that you
won't want to watch that broadcast.  You
know how NBC does the Thanksgiving Day Parade every year, and the parade
features an unhealthy number of lip-synced numbers from unwatchable Broadway musicals?  Well, picture one of those musical interludes
stretched to two hours.  That's what NBC
has in store for you.  The only saving

  If someone came to you right before you went to bed tonight,
and told you (credibly) that tomorrow would be the happiest day of your life,
how would that change the rest of your life?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I don't think it would change it much.  When you're 37, you are already
well aware that the happiest day of your life has probably already happened.  There was probably some day when I was a kid
when I was frolicking in mud and eating paste and was blissfully unaware of the
horrors of the world, like NAZIS and slavery and serial killers and all that.  No dark edge to my joy in any way.  That was probably the happiest day of my life
and now it's gone.
</p>
<p>
 But that's all right. 
Just because your happiest day is in the past doesn't make the somewhat
less happy days worse.  Besides, no one
can REALLY pinpoint the happiest day of their lives.  It's an arbitrary listicle.  Was it your wedding day?  The day your kids were born?  The day you graduated?  The day your favorite sports team won a
title?  It's hard to single out one exact
day and say yes, THAT was it.  Anyone who
claims otherwise is a liar or is trying to impress

 .  Memories are too fleeting and life is far too formless and unquantifiable for that to be the case.  As
a grownup, every day has its varying percentages of good and bad shit happening.  You know too much about the world for it to
be otherwise.  And as an adult, I almost
treasure the bad as much as I treasure the good, like when Louis CK talked
about crying on the side of the road:
</p>
<p>
 You can have a shitty day and, in a strange way, appreciate the
shittiness when something makes you angry or sad, or something shocks you in a
way that you'll never forget.  Life needs
that color, even if it isn't always fun to experience firsthand.  At least you get something fun to bitch about
the NEXT day, which is all I ever want in the Internet age.  It's important to me to find things that
anger me every day, so that I might hop on Twitter and tell the world how much
it angers me.  Like stale bread, AMIRITE
GUYZ?!  That pleases me.
</p>
<p>
 I'm gonna tell you about a good day.  I was 19 and a virgin.  I took a girl out bowling and brought her
back to my folks' house.  They were not
home.  I poured her a glass of water as
we stood in the kitchen and stared at each other for a little bit.  And then, after an awkward pause, I went for
it and kissed her and I'll be goddamned if she didn't kiss me right back.  Then she let me take her shirt off.  Right there in the kitchen (Sorry, ma).  FIRST SHIRTLESS WOMAN YO.  After we hooked up, I drove her home.  Then I got on the highway, driving nowhere in
particular, and sang along to the radio as loud as I possibly could.  That was a good day.  If that was the best day ever, or it was my
wedding day, or it was that time I went to a party shitfaced and everyone knew
the words to "Pour Some Sugar on Me" and sang along to it in perfect
unison, or it was that time I took my kid out for an ice cream sundae and she
never got up from the table ONCE while we ate, I'm OK if things are never
quite that amazing again.

<p>
 As a viewer, I get annoyed about this as well, because I
could be missing out in precious banter between two never-before-paired guests.  I would like to see what Jennifer Lawrence
has to say to that chimp lady!
</p>
<p>
 But I get why they take off as soon as possible.  I went to a taping of "Conan" this
fall and during the commercial break, everyone just sits there awkwardly while
the band plays real loud and the stagehands move shit around.  It's not a natural social environment.  Also, it's cold as shit, and there's free
food and booze waiting for you in the green room.  These GLORY BOY celebrities are so used to
being on television that they take it for granted, I tell you!
</p>
<p>
 By the way, any time you go to a live taping like this,
there is always 500,000 pounds of lighting and electrical equipment hanging
from the ceiling over the entire stage. 
And I spend the entire taping wondering if some rope overhead will snap
and a giant lighting rig will crush and kill everyone below.  I don't WANT that to happen.  I'm just saying it looks threatening.  I don't trust some lazy ME-FIRST UNION WORKER
to secure that boom.

  I feel a sense of great personal satisfaction every time I
open a condiment packet perfectly just so that only the corner is diagonally
ripped, thus allowing me to direct a perfect even stream of mustard on my
hot dog. Obviously, the alternative to this is when you rip the packet in half
so that the contents come out in one shapeless glob all over your fingers.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I have also tried to rip off a perfect corner only to
realize that I haven't actually created an opening in the pouch at all.  All I did was create an extra piece of
garbage.  And then I tear it down the
middle and everything goes to shit.  This
is why all fast food joints need to emulate Chick Fil-A and hand out the
newfangled Heinz packets that give a "squeeze or dip" option.  Whole new world of french fry consumption.  But I know other places won't do this because
that packaging is probably .0001 cents more expensive than the old, shitty
packets.
</p>
<p>
 Packaging costs are a big fucking deal to companies.  I worked on the Hershey's ad account for a
bit right when they changed the Kit Kat packaging to save money.  Kit Kat used to come in a foil wrapper and
paper sleeve, and opening it was a delight. 
Like treasure, it was!  But that
shit cost money, so they switched to plastic wrap instead.  IT'S NOT THE SAME.  Worst day of my life, people.
</p>
<p>
 By the way, one of the more agonizing things in life is when
you try to open a bag of cereal or chips clean across the top and, instead, you
get a tear going straight down the middle. 
Ruins the whole fucking bag.  I
should probably leave the opening of things to more experienced hands.

necessarily terrify me, but I'm in no hurry because of the impending failure. I
know it's not normal, but what's your take?
 </p>

<p>
 It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.  If you feel like all relationships are doomed
to fail, then PRESTO!  All of your
relationships are probably doomed to fail. 
You have to believe that&mdash;despite all the divorce and adultery and
economic woes and gourd porn out there&mdash;that somehow YOUR relationship is
special enough to transcend all that.  It
takes a certain blend of naivete and breathtaking arrogance to believe that
(it's why young couple are really fucking annoying), but that's how pretty much
every relationship starts out.  Most relationships
don't end that way.  Most of them end
with a vase being thrown at your face.  But
you HAVE to start out that way or else you'll just be some asshole with a
shitty attitude who dies alone.
</p>
<p>
 I've been married 11 years now.  Is it 11 years?  I really have to work hard to remember at
this point.  Before I met my wife, I had
 <a href="http://kissingsuzykolber.uproxx.com/2008/05/fictional-cheerleader-biography-casie.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  a
nightmarish relationship with another girl
 </a>
 that lasted for 18 grueling months.  Somewhere in there, in
a desperate attempt to stop the fighting, I suggested to this girl that we go
get married.  Not a formal proposal, but
just one of those times when a guy talks about marriage just to drum up the
romance.  I easily could have married
(and divorced) that girl at some point. 
The door to an alternate dimension slides and I'm trapped in an unhappy
and unstable union with an insane person, with maybe a kid thrown in for added
misery.  It happens to plenty of
people.
</p>
<p>
 Instead, somehow that relationship ground to a merciful end
before I did anything stupid, and I am now happily married.  I have no way of knowing if that'll ALWAYS be
the case, but I have faith that it will be. 
This December, my parents will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary,
which is completely insane.  I should buy
them a bag of wild rice or something for the effort.  There's no guarantee that your relationship
will succeed, but that doesn't mean it's doomed to fail.  Some of them DO work.  You gotta have faith in the girl and in
yourself that you'll love each other enough to work through all of the
horseshit.  It's worth the risk, even if
you end up failing.  That's why
motherfuckers get married over and over again. 
You see some guy getting married for the third time and you think,
"What is that moron doing?"  He
wants to believe, even if that isn't the practical thing to do.

<p>
 The latter is worse because it's painful and the pain
lingers.  If you get salsa on your
knuckle, you can just lick it clean off and get right back to dipping, much to
the horror of fellow partygoers.  But if
you get snow up your sleeve or down your crack, you are in for an extended
period of cold, wet, sodden misery. 
Sometimes I try sucking the melted snow out of my jacket sleeve, only
that makes everything smell like drool. 
So now I'm cold and I smell like fucking drool.  WORST DAY EVER.  As an adult, I have no tolerance for
this.  Kids don't mind.  A kid will get snow down the crack and stay
outside for another eight hours until they come down with scarlet fever.  I can't roll like that anymore.  I'm not young enough to ignore the
misery.

 Also, a bonus FUCK YOU to snow when it gets on woolen
garments like gloves and collars and forms little ice clumps that cannot be
shaken off.  You've got some nerve, snow.

wildly in all instances.

 Anyway, let's say you're drunk, and therefore you have a sweet
spot for any woman between the ages of 20 (being generous here about your
chivalry) and 45.  Census data gives you
about 1.3 billion ladies to toy around with in that demographic.  Let's go ahead and drop half of those women
due to varying factors: looks, criminal backgrounds, possible communicable
diseases, bunions, etc.  That still
leaves you with over 9 percent of the world's population.  Somehow, that feels low.  You're a man.

  How many of the bottom NFL teams (starting with the worst by

worst team could cherry pick the players from those teams. They would probably
never get a decent QB but the rest of the team could be good enough to
compensate.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 You could make a dominant NFL team with just two shit teams.
 In this day and age, the difference
between the league's worst team and its best isn't that big anyway.  Tampa went to Seattle and hung three TDs on
the Seahawks before they finally caught up.  If you combined the best players from Tampa
with the best players from Jacksonville or Atlanta or Minnesota or Houston,
you'd have a fucking great team.
</p>
<p>
 If you combine the Jags and Bucs, you'd have an offense with
a rapidly improving Mike Glennon at the helm, with MJD as your back, V-Jax and
Cecil Shorts at wideout, Darrelle Revis in the secondary, Paul Posluszny and
Lavonte David in the linebacking corps, and you'd have Gus Bradley booting Greg
Schiano out the door.  That team can win
twelve games easily.  Hell, both the
Texans and Falcons were Super Bowl contenders before this season started.  They have both had shitty, unlucky, injury-plagued,
miserable seasons, but that doesn't diminish the talent on either roster.  If you combined the Falcons and Texans and
had Matt Ryan throwing to Andre Johnson with J.J. Watt batting balls on the other
side, you'd have a fucking juggernaut.

wedding ring &mdash; as if it was a comforting patrolman's badge or something, an
implied announcement proclaiming "AT EASE MA'AM, I AM NOT A RAPEY
MURDERER!!" This was entirely stupid, of course, in that evildoers can
probably wear wedding rings, too. How much less threatened did she feel because
of my wedding ring? 65%? Zero? (Also, I was dressed in a business suit not a
rubber butcher's apron, so factor that in too.)
 </p>

<p>
 You're assuming that she noticed your wedding ring at all,
which she probably didn't.  Or if you
flashed it too conspicuously, she probably thought you were some crazy asshole
who was like I CAN'T HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH YOU EVEN THOUGH I'D BE DOWN WITH IT
(One of my favorite parts of

 is when Bruce Willis flashes his wedding ring at a cute airport clerk who hits
on him&mdash;I've been dying to smoothly rebuff a come-on like that for 11 years

to have an impact in that scenario, certainly compared to your general
appearance, race (unfortunately), wardrobe, and body odor.

<p>
 Having your actual wife with you is another matter, by the
way.  That eliminates the threat
entirely.  If I see one other dude in a

  So I am middle school PE teacher. I have had bronchitis and

"Here's a present I hope will make you feel better". I have almost 250
evil preteens to argue with/attempt to force a workout into, so I do not know
many of their names yet. They have them scrawled across their PE shirts in my
poor handwriting with a black Sharpie, but this little girl had not yet changed
so I had no clue who she was. I simply said, "Thank you" and took
them. And then I looked at my "gift". Pizza flavored hard candy.

puke. I just couldn't do it. The whole bag is still in my desk.

  My question to you is this- is this a truly innocent and
thoughtful child? Does she like this candy and wanted to share the joy of it
with me? Did her parents invent it and are trying to make a buck by giving it
away and spreading its popularity ? Or is it a backhanded insult, saying this
is what she thinks of me? As cynical as I am, dealing with these midget
