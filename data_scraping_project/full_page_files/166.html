 I was at an intersection on a six lane road the other day
and I had to make a left.  So in the
opposite lane nearest to me, a Good Samaritan stopped to let me turn.  The problem was that she was basically asking
me to commit suicide, because motorists in the next two lanes over gave the
zeroest of fucks about letting me turn.  I
have no idea what to do in that situation. 
You feel like a dick if you turn down the "gift" but come on,
people.  Anyway, I started to make the
turn slowly and hoped people wouldn't T-bone me.  Between risking death and not having people
like me, I choose death.

  Would people nowadays prefer a selfie or an autograph?

<p>
 So by a selfie, I assume you mean a selfie taken WITH the
celebrity of your choosing?  I think the
selfie wins in a landslide.  You can take
the selfie and then send it out to friends and post it on Twitter and
humblebrag about the time you met James Franco outside a burger truck.  That has greater value over getting an
autograph now.
</p>
<p>
 I think that memorabilia dealers are such losers that
they've destroyed the inherent value of an autograph.  I wouldn't ask anyone famous for an autograph
now because I'd feel like a fucking creep. 
I don't wanna have anything in common with Dale Fatrag at the Pete Rose
Vegas Souvenir Rodeo.  Much better to
snap a quick picture together and make my friends feel like LOOZERS for not
hanging out with Dustin Hoffman.  Look at
me now, guys!  I am somebody.

  Don't you think the Edge from U2 regrets his stupid decision
to be all iconic with his knit hat? "It's August in bloody St. Louis and I
have to wear this fucking hat Bono?!?!"
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think The Edge's hat decisions are entirely his own.  Back in the '80s he was rocking that OTHER
hat.  You know, the one with the
brim?  That was during the whole
 <em>
  Rattle &amp; Hum
 </em>
 era when Bono decided he was a native Louisiana bluesman
GUMBO GUMBO GUMBO TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YE GUMBO.  Possibly the most annoying version of Bono,
and that's saying quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe Bono offers vague and pointless suggestions for
Edge's hat ("It needs come from the throat of the bayou, Dave.")&mdash;dictated
by whatever identity the band feels like occupying at the moment in order to
capitalize on worldwide music trends&mdash;but I think the lead guitarist maintains
ultimate hat sovereignty.  If I were the
Edge, I would choose the hat that Bono liked least as a form of quiet
protest.

  I'm 19, a freshman in college, and have never had the
slightest intention of smoking weed. For some reason, I've always put it on the
same plane as every other drug, even though I know after a half a second's thought
that that's ridiculous. The problem is, since the start of college, ALL of my
friends have started smoking weed out of nowhere. They offer it to me, and to
their credit don't push it on me when I politely decline.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know it's *technically* no worse than drinking, which I do
regularly, but still. I can't help but feel incredibly weird about them doing
it. Just how big of a jackass am I being? Should I try it once just so it
doesn't seem so foreign to me?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Nah.  If you really
don't want to try it, then you shouldn't. 
It's not for everyone.  I never
smoked weed in high school or college.  I
regret this, because it really would have taken the stick out of my ass, but
it's not that big of a deal for you to opt out.
</p>
<p>
 I have a hard time admitting this to myself, but the truth
is that weed can often be vastly overrated. 
I
 <em>
  want
 </em>
 to like it.  It looks fun and relaxing and cool people do
it in movies and shit.  The legalization
movement has made such incredible strides over the past decade that it's hard to
sit back and admit that&mdash;just like with drinking&mdash;smoking weed isn't always a
blast.  Sometimes you get a shitty high
and feel all paranoid.  Sometimes you'll
get high and a speck of paint over in the corner will start annoying the shit
out of you.  Sometimes you get high and
feel like a bag of dead cats.  It's not
always the little mental Jamaican getaway that you imagine it to be.  Sometimes it just makes you feel useless and
stupid.  And the powerful strains and
concentrates you can take now often serve to make you feel more useless and
stupid.  It's like enhanced boredom.  You can't concentrate.  Nothing fully holds your interest except a
taco.
</p>
<p>
 So don't bother if you're not into it.  It's not like you're missing out on inventing
cold fusion by smoking it.  Chances are
you can live a happy and productive life without it.

 Kevin:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Throughout most of college I dated a girl who I thought I
would one day marry, but who ended up cheating on me and breaking my heart.  Fast forward a few years and now I'm 24 with
a college degree, a good job, and a wonderful new girl. Seemingly life is going
pretty well, but I can't shake this anxious feeling that this new girl is going
to hurt me as well. I've been able to hide it well, but the more invested we
get in each other, the more anxious I feel. It's to the point now where I can't
effectively hide it anymore and it's starting to spill over into our
relationship. My question is, how do I get over/past this feeling? This new girl
is awesome and I want to give us the best possible shot of succeeding.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Hiding your anxiety only makes it worse.  If you keep all that fear and tension inside
and then lash out at the new girl because she ordered the wrong pizza or
something, things are only gonna go downhill from there.  You'll have to come clean and sit her down
and tell her all of your worries.  And
make sure you tell her, "Now, I know it's not necessarily rational to feel
this way."  That helps a lot when
you're hashing out feelings.  You tell
the other person, "Look, I know this might not be rational, but I'm just
trying to be honest when I tell you I feel that YOU LOOK STUPID IN THAT FUCKING
HAT."  Really takes the edge off.  A good relationship is one where you feel
free to share your feelings without fear of judgement or a vase to the
forehead.
</p>
<p>
 If you're open and candid without being accusatory, I assume
the new girl will give you a big hug and reassure you that this is a new
relationship and that you can trust her. 
Or maybe she'll shiv you in the ribs and take your money because she was
an escaped fugitive who was on the lam this whole time.  But that seems unlikely.
</p>
<p>
 It can hard to trust people after coming out of a shitty
relationship.  Some guy will break up
with an ex-girlfriend who is dishonest or mentally unstable and then
immediately paint the rest of womanhood with that same brush.  BITCHES BE CRAY CRAY.  Happens all the time.  I had a terrible ex-girlfriend and every time
we fought&mdash;real mean-spirited arguing&mdash;she'd keep saying that this was
normal for a relationship.  And that
would, in turn, make me fear leaving and trying out a new relationship, since I
was under the impression that they would all end up the same way.  NOT TRUE. 
No two relationships are alike and, if you're willing, you can usually
find yourself in one where both the guy and girl are on equal footing.  And then you get married and have a kid and
the kid OWNS YOUR SHIT.  It's really
nice!

  Say you find the best high school football offense in the

<p>
 No.  In fact, they'd
probably end that quarter with four healthy boys left standing.  I don't know how you keep those kids from NOT

 Ian:

 <p>
  How tall would a woman have to be, in order for NBA teams to
have to consider using her for pure height? She can run reasonably well for a
big, and she has cleared a physical. She doesn't have super powers, so she's
not hitting 50% from 3, but she's good enough to rebound and block shots with
the men. At the very least she's no worse than Shawn Bradley. Forbes says 17%
of 7 foot tall men are in NBA, so would she have to be 7'6"? Eight feet?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think over eight feet and able to dunk and block shots
without having to jump.  That kind of
insane physical advantage would be impossible to overlook even if every NBA
scout would be like, "Yes, but can she take a POUNDING?!"  Very important in any sports that you be able
to withstand pounding of any kind.  After
all, sports are just cleverly disguised excuses for men to pound each
other.  If you're gonna bring your
sky-high vagina into this, you better be able to pound!
</p>
<p>
 By the way, I don't think this will ever happen.  I don't think there will ever be a woman
physically gifted enough to break through and start for an NFL team (kickers
don't count!) or an NBA team.  You would
need a kind of freakish ability that so far surpasses that of your male counterparts
that teams would gladly overlook all the political ramifications of bringing a
woman into the fold. (
 <a href="http://deadspin.com/distractions-are-bullshit-1495443299" rel="nofollow">

 !) The
human skeleton didn't evolve to support someone who is eight feet tall, so
even if a woman came along who was the correct undeniable height, she'd
probably be too busy having her feet re-broken and put into braces to try out
for the Bucks.

 So Chris Kluwe blew up the Internet last week with this post, entitled "I Was An NFL Player&hellip;

<p>
 Kevin:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  A while back, when the yellow line wasn't working for a
couple of plays and I was in my usual state of sheer panic that it was never
going to come back, I got to wondering what football on TV is going to look
like 10 or 15 years from now, and what we don't have right now that we're
going to be completely dependent on in the future. What do you think the next
few "can't live without" yellow line style innovations are going to
be for TV football?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I really don't know how I lived before the yellow line or
the FoxBox.  I may as well have been blind.  I remember that NBC was the last holdout when
it came to showing the score at all times because Dick Ebersol thought it gave
people a reason to change the channel, which makes him the absolute worst.  You could go 20 minutes on an NBC game
without knowing what the goddamn score was. 
They may as well have put a middle finger icon on the bottom of the
screen instead.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, I think a sideline buzzer ought to be implemented
somewhere down the line.  Just like the
technology in tennis that can detect a foot fault, I don't see why the NFL
can't have a thing that buzzes if it detects a foot that has gone out of
bounds.  Then you wouldn't need to sit
there and eyebang a replay that's been zoomed in eight times to the point of
looking like an 8-bit videogame.
</p>
<p>
 Networks could also use a NERDY NERD sabermetric formula to
figure out when timeouts should be deployed, and then flash an OPTIMAL TIMEOUT
MOMENT graphic on the screen to make the coach look like an idiot when he
decides to bypass it.  Because honestly, I have no idea when you should really take that timeout.  That would be of
greater use to me than the field goal range line, which ESPN tried to make
happen this college football season but is NOT welcome on my TV screen.
</p>
<p>
 I also need a dimmer for any football game that takes place
in a half-shaded stadium.  It's never fun
to watch some game being played in Oakland where the runner starts off in the
shade, then runs into the sunny part of the stadium and you immediately go
blind from the transition.  It's like I'm
staring at a white dwarf.  That needs to
be evened out.
</p>
<p>
 It's a miracle, frankly, that networks found useful telecast
innovations like the yellow line.  You're
talking about people that still have graphics with Phil Simms' Keys to the
Game, featuring bullet points and then the words "Stop the run".  These are not forward-thinking people.

  What is the point of sleeveless undershirts (wife beaters)?
The absolute only reason I wear an undershirt is so I don't get pit stains on
my nice shirts, and a wife beater completely defeats that purpose. Does
anyone's torso actually get that cold under a shirt?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think the reason people wear beaters (apart from, you
know, beating) is so that you can't see the sleeve lines through a nice
shirt.  I guess those are the male
equivalent of panty lines, although I don't really feel as if I've pulled off
some great ruse if people can't tell I have an undershirt on.  ONLY MY HAIRDRESSER KNOWS FOR SURE.
</p>
<p>
 That's the reason sleeveless undershirts exist.  If you think that's worth the open pit stains
and enhanced man boobage that comes with rocking a beater, that's entirely your
decision.  But I'd be just as
self-conscious rocking a beater as I would rocking a basketball jersey.  You may as well cut out holes where my bitch
tits are.  No thanks.
</p>
<p>
 (FUN FACT: Back in college, there were beater parties.  These were not actual parties, just a group
decision by football players to wear beaters only while drinking beer and
playing Madden.  It just feels MEANER,
really.  It's as close as your average
college student gets to being a mobster sitting in a jailhouse kitchen.)

 It's hard because those are forced circumstances.  These are people you see only because they

  For about 4 summers in a row when I was in high
school/college I used to drive down to Kiawah island in South Carolina and stay
with some family friends for an end of summer vacation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pretty much the entirety of the trip consisted of golf all
day long. The golf courses down there are packed with all sorts of
wildlife- gators, snakes, and of course GIGANTIC spiders that just nestle
wherever they see fit.
 </p>
 <p>
  So on one particular day, I tee off from the 9th hole and am
walking from the tee to a water jug to refill my water. Water refilled I begin
walking walking up the fairway and go to take a sip of my water. As soon as the
water enters my mouth I feel something hit my tongue and literally latch on to
my entire tongue. It took me a split second to realize that a bee wasn't in my
water but a godamn spider. He was hanging on the spicket of the water jug
and he ended up in my mouth biting my tongue. I frantically pulled it out of my
mouth looking down to see a golf ball sized brown spider that just had his way
with my mouth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Luckily I was on the ninth hole and was able to run in and
grab Benadryl but that didn't stop my tongue from swelling to beyond the point
where I couldn't close my mouth all the way and freaking out like a girl seeing
a bug for the first time.
