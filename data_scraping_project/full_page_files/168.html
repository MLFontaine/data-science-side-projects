  Pranksters are ALWAYS horrible people, yes? Practical jokers

<p>
 Yep!  All you need to
know is that Mel Gibson is supposedly infamous for pranking people on movie
sets to know this is true.
 <em>
  Someone

 </em>
 Like, it's one thing for
teenagers to do it to one another because teenagers are the worst.  But if you're a 40-year-old man stuffing
dead fish into your assistant's suitcase, you're basically a serial killer.
</p>
<p>
 There are two kinds of practical jokes out there.  The first kind preys on another person's
fears.
 <em>
  Oh my god, Bob!  You killed that taxi driver!  You better hope they take you to jail before
his family avenges the killing!  JK WE
HIRED AN ACTOR AND PUT BLAST CAPS UNDER HIS SHIRT LULZ
 </em>
 .  The other kind of practical joke preys on a
person's hopes.
 <em>
  Oh my God, Bob!
 </em>
 <em>
  You just won the lottery!  You can finally afford that new kidney!  JK YOU'RE STILL BROKE AND NEED DIALYSIS
 </em>
 .  So either you're making someone sick with
worry or you're crushing their dreams, which is fun if you're an asshole!
</p>
<p>
 It's one thing to exploit those hopes and fears a little
bit, like if you take Bob's jacket and move it five hooks over and then he gets
all mad because he can't find it. 
HAHAHA WHAT A LOSER.  That's fine
between friends on occasion.  But if
you're the kind of nutjob who's willing to sustain a lie over the course of
HOURS just so you can watch a friend or co-worker tear their own hair out,
you're probably getting suspended by the Dolphins.  Only Justin Bieber still finds
 <em>
  Punk'd
 </em>
 to be
entertaining.  That shit has an age
limit, and practical jokes have REALLY been beaten to death in the age of the
Internet, where people post stupid hoaxes every five seconds.  I don't need all this jokey joking in my
life.  I just want that picture of a
squirrel fucking a monkey to be REAL.
</p>
<p>
 I also hate the fear of escalation involved with this
shit.  I worked in an office a while
back and my officemate and I had a couch. 
As a "joke," two co-workers stole that couch and put it in their
office.  So then we stole it back.  Then they stole it back again and took a
pencil too.  By the third round of the
prank cycle, I was like
 <em>
  you know what? 
How about you stop stealing our goddamn couch?
 </em>
 I couldn't even enjoy the couch when we had it because I
feared walking in the next day to find it missing.  THEY GOT IN MY HEAD. 
Getting in my head is a cock move! 
I'm too old to be sitting there trying to negotiate a fucking prank
truce.

 <p>
  Bringing back the not-too-fresh anymore PAT fight: How about
Quidditch style hoops? There could be just one, or up to 3, with the varying
levels of difficulty of each hoop worth different amount of points (although I admit
this one is probably too far fetched). A circular goal to kick into would not
only force the kicker to contend with the height as well as heightening the
other factors (wind) to near amazing levels.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I'd be fine with that, but I'm sure the competition
committee would dismiss it as a "novelty," which is the word people use when
something is just too fun for them to tolerate.  DURRR THIS AIN'T NO SKEEBALL GAME THIS FOOTBAW DURRRR.  Football is a sport that takes itself very
seriously, so anything that feels sort of goofy or silly is not welcome, with
the apparent exception of

<p>
 Frank Caliendo's a bit of a schmuck, but this skit for a fake Richard Sherman 30 For 30 has&hellip;
</p>
<p>
 There are now so many viable alternatives to the idea of the
PAT that I fear the NFL will be unable to choose one.  As a fanbase, we need to settle on one to push onto the Ginger Hammer
so that he doesn't get confused and then decide with his big dumb brain to keep
things the way they are.  That's why I'm
firmly on board with the "a touchdown is worth seven but you can go for it from
the two to make it eight points but if you fail it goes down to six" proposal.

 Also, if we had kicking hoops, Jimmy Graham would dunk on
them and tear them down five times a season.

 <p>
  If humans reached their physical and mental prime and then
never aged after that, but they would still live the average human lifespan
(around 85 years), would people live their lives completely different or would
we still try to follow the blueprint of going to college, getting a job,
getting married, and having kids and a house as soon as possible?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think that people would probably choose to get married and
have kids a little bit later than they already do, but they'd still do it.  The biological drive to poop out kids would
still be there, and women would still have a limited number of eggs to fertilize
and, I assume, would still face the usual dangers of having children past the
age of 35 or so. (Congrats!  You win
eight months of bedrest!) One of the cruel disconnects between men and women is that a healthy man is basically fertile
for life and a healthy woman is not.  If
it weren't a matter of urgency for women, most men would wait until age 89 to
start having kids, Anthony Quinn-style.
</p>
<p>
 And we still get married and have kids in 2014 despite the
fact that A) we live much longer than we did centuries ago, B) thanks to rhinoplasty
and boob jobs, we look far better at an older age than we did centuries ago, and C)
we're all far more repulsively self-involved then we were centuries ago.  So having your age frozen at 26 or whenever
you look your grooviest probably wouldn't stop you from settling into your
socially conditioned family rut.  GOODY!
</p>
<p>
 The only thing is that you would see a lot more marriages
and hookups between really old people and really young people.  Some world-wise 78-year-old dude could
really clean up with your local sorority house.  Why, he'd leave nothing for you!

 <p>
  What percentage of American men do you estimate know where a
woman pees from?  My boyfriend is in his late 20s, has had sex with more
than five women, is above average intelligence, and until last night thought
women peed out of their buttholes.  He literally yelled
  <em>
   NOOOOOOOOOO
  </em>
  when
I informed him that us ladies pee from the front, just like you gentlemen.  I
am truly astounded at his ignorance, but he insists that many, if not most, men
would be utterly shocked to learn this about the female anatomy.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 That can't be true, can it? 
Did that man never see an issue of
 <em>
  Penthouse
 </em>
 during its piss fetish
heyday?  Everything I know about female
urination I learned from
 <em>
  Penthouse
 </em>
 .  I
totally know women don't pee out the butt, so gold star for me!
</p>
<p>
 I would estimate that a relatively low percentage of grown
men share your boyfriend's ignorance.  I
think they're much more apt to believe that women pee out the vagina.  I know that's what I thought: that women
were vagidexterous.  But no!  Turns out there's a whole other faucet.  Seems inefficient.  I say that 40% of men know about the extra hole thing.  Textbook diagrams are useless because a
cross section diagram of the female reproductive system looks like a blueprint
of Luke Skywalker's uncle's house.

 <p>
  Given all of the reports about the amount of casual sex that
happens in the Olympic village, and the fact that this isn't anything new at
all, do you think that there's currently an Olympic athlete that is the product
of an Olympic village hookup? And if not, how has that not happened?! For
decades, world-class athletes have been having sex with each other, and that hasn't
produced ONE amazingly athletic love child? Do you think that, maybe some have
been conceived, but because the mom was probably such a dedicated athlete and
devoted her entire life to training and competing (and obviously had no
intentions of getting pregnant) she had the potential Olympic baby aborted? I
just find it hard to believe that there hasn't been some Olympic love child
born, and if so, how there hasn't been at least one that ended up being a
phenomenal Olympic athlete him or herself.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Oh, I'm sure it's happened at some point.  Yao Ming is famously the product of
government-mandated athlete breeding, and who the fuck knows how many East
Germans were forced to mate just before the steroids kicked in and they grew a
penis on each hip.  There's an Olympic
superbaby in there somewhere, although perhaps having two Olympic parents
becomes too much of a burden for the child. 
Maybe Junior goes walking through the house resenting all of Mommy's
gold medals.  Maybe he HATES bobsled
practice and is only doing it to make Daddy happy.  Maybe he turns to brown heroin as a release valve for all the
unbearably high expectations, and then gets kicked out of the house when he
pawns Daddy's silver medal for handjob money. 
That's probably what would happen.

They have the Germans two spots below us with 8, but they have 6 GOLD! I would
much rather have 6 gold then 5 bronze and 3 gold (silver is a wash AND the
first loser).
 </p>
 <p>
  It should be a weighted system, I propose: 12 points for gold, 6 for silver and
2 for bronze. By that math, the U.S. has 52 points and the Germans have 80,
they are kicking our asses!
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Not only that, but medal counts are inflated depending upon
the sport.  If you win the gold medal in
ice hockey, that counts as ONE medal in the standings, which is complete
horseshit.  Some cross-country
dipshit from Norway can have triple the impact if he wins one of his sport's 9,000 different medal heats: the 1000m, the 2000m, the 3569m, and so
on.  If you win the ice hockey gold,
that should count as a medal for each dude on the team.  It would be the Golden Snitch of the medal
count.

 It shouldn't take you that long if you have a healthy

<p>
 But if you're not lollygagging, you should be able to
complete a bowel movement in relatively short order.  Taking 20 minutes basically means you're constipated,
probably because you ate a nine-pound burger last night and are still waiting
for all the rectal vinegar to dribble out of your body.  Nothing worse than a slow case of aggressive diarrhea.

 of this, and it won't shock you to learn that California is far and away the
winner, because California is the most populous state and because Californians
are so irritatingly active.
 <em>

 </em>
 Shut up, California.  You are one giant humblebrag of a
state.
</p>
<p>
 Cali has double the number of medals of second place New
York, and color me shocked that New York has produced so many Olympians given
that New Yorkers spent most of their lives waiting for a 4 train that will
never arrive.  Illinois, Ohio, and Texas
round out the top 5, with Florida all the way down at a shocking 14

 place.  I thought Florida churned out as
many Olympic athletes as methheads, but I was wrong!
</p>
<p>
 Three states have never won a medal of any sort: North
Dakota, Delaware, and Rhode Island. 
These are not elite states.  We
should cut them off and annex Scandinavia to boost our medal totals.

 I believe it took six straight pick-six games for Matt

<p>
 Anyway, I think if we're talking about Drew Brees, I think
he would get a pass for the first game. 
Just a bad day at the office, guys! Then by the
second game he would probably get pulled, then start the next week, throw a few
more picks, and then get pulled for good. 
I think that would take roughly 15 passes.  Then he would get a chance to start the NEXT
season because it's Drew Brees and you'd feel like an idiot if you didn't try
to revive his career.  Then he would get
cut, picked up by one other team, throw a few picks for them, get cut again,
and then be out of football.  No higher
than 20 picks or so, because once teams start wondering if you're finished,
you usually already are.

  My wife and I got caught by our 6 yr old last night.
 The lights were off and he was half asleep but got the feeling that

pajama pants over my raging hard on and he proceeded to ask me what mommy was
doing when he opened the door.
 </p>
 <p>
  Showing some uncharacteristically quick thinking I told him
that his mother had just gotten out of the bathtub and thought she heard a
noise and jumped on me to wake me up.  He bought it and while eating his
breakfast this morning apologized for scaring her.  What is the over under
on what age he comes home from school and tells us that we were in fact having
sex when he walked in?

<p>
 Fortunately for you, he'll probably take that to the
grave.  He'll either just delude himself
as an adult and continue to buy your version of events, or he'll realize you
were fucking and then do everything possible to quell the horror.  He's not just gonna pop down the stairs one
day and be like WAIT!  YOU GUYS WERE
SCREWING!  I TOTALLY GET IT NOW!  That won't happen.
</p>
<p>
 The only time he'll ever bring it up is when he turns 12,
because 12-year-olds are old enough to know about sex and still just stupid
enough to talk openly about it.  One
time, when I was 12, I came downstairs and announced to the entire breakfast
table that I had had a wet dream the night before.  This was a lie, actually. 
I was just stroking in my bed, wide awake.  But I thought if I blamed a wet dream, my mom wouldn't get mad
about the sheets.  Anyway, my dad took
me aside and we had a brutal three-minute talk about sex ("You might start to notice
women more!"), and then I never brought up sex with my folks again.  Twelve-year-olds are idiots.

 You need to use a big container so that there's room for the

 <p>
  The
Sochi double toilets got my reminiscing about the funniest sports poop I've
ever witnessed. In 1997, I was a freshman in high school in middle Georgia and
I was on the football team. I played on the freshman squad, but I dressed out
for the varsity games. This meant I just stood around on the sideline in my
pads and uniform (PLAYING GRABASS), but I got to travel with the team, eat a
free meal, and run through that huge pre-game banner and feel super badass. I
also got to hang around the varsity players in the locker room and learn how to
play FOOTBAW like a grownass man.
 </p>
 <p>
  My high
school was in Warner Robins, Georgia, where football is bigger than Jesus. At
the end of my senior season, 20,000 people showed up to our city championship
game. But in 1997, we were just so-so. We made the playoffs, even won our
first-round game, but had to travel south to Valdosta for the second round.
Valdosta, in case you haven't heard, is the winningest high school football
team in the nation (23 state titles and 6 national titles, which doesn't even
make sense).
 </p>
 <p>
  Valdosta's
football tradition was rich, but their visiting locker room was not. Locker
rooms at high schools in south Georgia are, let's just say, Spartan. Typically,
there's just one big open room with a few benches. Quite often there were no
actual lockers in the locker room. Showers were rare. Coaches had to
BYOwhiteboard. Scrubs like freshman-me sat on the floor while the starters sat
on the benches and got cussed out by the coaches for playing like shit.
Sometimes the visiting team's locker room was adjacent to the home team's
locker room, and post-game fights were common (often we weren't allowed to take
our helmets off until we'd boarded the bus home).
 </p>
 <p>
  Smelly
bus rides and postgame scuffles weren't a big deal to us, but these locker
rooms also had a complete lack of bathroom privacy. The typical "bathroom" was
about 2 or 3 crappers, a couple of urinals or a trough, and a sink. MAYBE
toilet paper. No stalls, no privacy walls, no doors, no nothing. Just a bunch
of toilets along a wall, in plain view of the rest of the room. If you had to
shit, you had to shit in front of the entire team.
 </p>
 <p>
  Valdosta's
visiting team locker room had a literal throne. It sat atop a set of stairs,
with no walls around it. To poop, you had to climb the stoop, drop trou and
conduct your business in plain view of everyone down below. (Disclaimer: I was
15 years old at the time, so my memory may have exaggerated the epic heights of
this throne. I remember this toilet being atop an Aztec Temple. That's
certainly not true. I looked for a picture, but couldn't find one. If you have
one, please share).
 </p>
 <p>
  Before
long road trips the whole team would gather in our school's cafeteria and eat
lunchlady spaghetti, then hop on buses for the ride to the wherever the game
was, in this case the game was a 2-hour ride into the football heart of south
Georgia. Players were not allowed to talk at any point from mealtime until warmups.
This included getting dressed in the locker room. Unless a coach was speaking
to you, If you even whispered before the team hit the field for warmups, you'd
be sentenced to death by grass drills the following Monday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether
it was the spaghetti lunch, the long ride, the stress of the post-season,
whatever, our starting center, a swaggering hulk of a man, got a case of what
we called "the bubble guts." In full pads, and in front of the entire team, he
climbed the stairs, de-pantsed and claimed that throne like goddamn Robert
Baratheon. The entire team sat below in stunned silence. To this day, the grin
on his face as he fouled that locker room while we all had to sit in silence,
pulling our jersey's up over our noses to both block the smell AND stifle
laughter, is one of the funniest, most disgusting things I've ever witnessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  We lost
45-7.
