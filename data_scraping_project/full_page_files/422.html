 I've been losing weight recently, and one of the joys of losing weight is overemphasizing my own awe at my body's transformation. "Why are my pants so loose? Why am I not sweating in my sleep? I feel stronger. More agile. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY BODY?" I'm not saying I'm becoming Spiderman, but I wouldn't rule out such things. Also, my old Kasabian shirt fits again. It's the little things. Onto your letters.

 <p>
  Me and my brother have come to the conclusion that whoever dies first will haunt the shit out of the other person. I'm gonna be a bad motherfuckin' ghost if I die, I will pull your teeth while you sleep, you bastard. FEAR ME.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well, that's the main issue. Can you move around tangible objects when you're a ghost? Because that would be awesome. If you're a ghost, you have to be bored out of your mind, what with the whole stuck in purgatory business. The only thing there is to do if you're a ghost is spend most of your time fucking with the living. And so, like Carlos, I'd be a HUGE dick if I were a ghost. I'd turn on the faucets while you were taking a shit, just so you'd clench up, break off the turd, and get all mad. Also, I'd write out lots of vague messages on steamy bathroom mirrors. Shit like, THIS IS THE DAWN OF THE END. Also, I'd implore people in the house to avenge my death, even if I died normally. They don't know I died of a heart attack, so why not give them the illusion that I was murdered in the house, and that they must find the killer? OLD MAN JENKINS NEXT DOOR! YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM!
</p>
<p>
 There are times, late at night, when my wife is asleep but I'm still tossing and turning, when I wonder if our house is haunted. It's not. But what if the specter of some old lady came through the wall and just stared at me? What would I do, apart from shit my pants? I visualize that shit, and then it fucks with me the rest of the night.
</p>
<p>
 At college, one of the guys I sat on the football bench with told me his dorm room was haunted. One night, he was sleeping in his bed. He stirred, opened his eyes, and saw a dark figure standing by the bed. When he reached to touch the figure, his hand went through it. He turned on the light and there was nothing there. HAUNTED! Sure, he was almost certainly lying. But then again, there could have been a girl who had her throat slit by a demented professor in that very same room. I rule out nothing. Just once, I'd like to find myself in a haunted house or hotel room. Just so I can tell people of my brush with the paranormal.
</p>
<p>
 I get very annoyed with reality shows about ghosts (like Ghost Hunters) that supposedly track ghosts and then come up with proof that includes a video still featuring a smudge of light glare. That's no ghost, you fuckers. Where are the chains?!

  My girlfriend (who I live with) is a moron. When she gets ready in the morning she will put her bra on, then her tank-top undershirt, then whatever shirt/sweater/blouse she decides to wear for the day. It is only after that process is complete that she decides to put deodorant on. Now that by itself is not weird, what is weird is how she puts the deodorant on. She goes DOWN through the NECK instead of up from the bottom of the shirt. The first time I saw this I almost shit myself, who the fuck wants to stretch the necks of their shirts out for deodorant?? GO THROUGH THE FUCKING BOTTOM LIKE EVERY NORMAL PERSON. What third world country is she from?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Your girl is not as moronic as you may think, good sir. Now, I almost always apply deodorant while shirtless. The only time I do it with a shirt on is if I have my shirt on, forget I put on deodorant, and am too lazy to remove my shirt to apply it. I find applying it with a shirt on to be deeply unsatisfying. I don't get to raise my arm all the way up and take a big swipe with the stick, as usual. I feel like Picasso when I do that. Plus, I get to stare at all the little deodorant bits now clinging to my pit hair. SO COOL.
</p>
<p>
 The problem with putting on the deodorant with my shirt off is that sometimes, if I do that and then put on my shirt, little deodorant marks will somehow end up on the bottom of my shirt. I have no fucking idea how this happens, but it happens often enough for me to question my entire application process. So your girl may be applying the deodorant with a shirt on to avoid getting deodorant on the outside of the shirt. As for the neck thing, I dunno. Is she a Christian Scientist? That may explain it.

  Since you seem to have an active daydreaming mind, I'm wondering if you ever have my most frequent one during long car drives: What if I just swerved my car off the side of the highway while going 80 mph? Not only do I envision doing this (while "fighting" the urge not to), but I also envision the police going to my parents/girlfriend to tell them, everyone I ever knew (and some people who don't know me) crying and mourning my death, a kickass funeral/eulogy, my girlfriend meeting another guy down the road and marrying him, etc. I have even caused my own eyes to start watering on occasion, but only because I throw myself in the moment and act like I'm one of the proletariat who will mourn my death. Is this weird or what? Note that I do not have any suicidal tendencies in the least bit, but a very active imagination.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Agreed. There is that part of my mind when I'm driving that's like, "Oh look! We're on a bridge! What if we just took a gander at the bottom of the Potomac there, fella?" It's just an odd thought that pops up. It has nothing to do with depression or anything like that. It's just one of those thoughts my mind processes and then discards. But that doesn't mean I don't think it. Like, I'll pick up a huge chef's knife and be like, "Damn, this is one bigass knife. What if I just plunged this fucker into my chest? That would be weird."
</p>
<p>
 I absolutely do the thing where I picture my own death and then imagine everyone totally sad that I'm gone. MAYBE YOU PEOPLE WILL FINALLY LEARN TO APPRECIATE ME! I've also envisioned myself getting cancer and having this long, overwrought struggle, where everyone's crying and I record videos for my kids to watch when they get older. I totally blame that shitty movie
 <em>

 for that. I wish I'd never seen it. That movie is 100% cancer porn. "Now Jimmy, when I'm gone, you're going to need to learn how to shoot a jumpshot."

 It really depends on maintenance costs. How much fuel does a Transformer need? Is Bumblebee there fueled by his own alien Transformer space rock shit? Or does he only get .00005 miles a gallon/step?
</p>
<p>
 Regardless, I'd want the transformer. Jordan made a sound argument in a portion of his email for the Terminator, but with a Transformer you get both a robot AND a kickass vehicle of some sort. A Terminator is only a robot. And while it's nice, in theory, to use it to kill people, I actually don't want to kill anyone. And there's just no point in having a Terminator if you can't terminate with it. If I had a Terminator, I'd just make him stay up and guard the house. Also, I'd teach him to babysit. I bet he could learn to change a diaper without tearing the kid's leg off.

 It depends on weight. Since I'm a big guy, I look like a fucking slob in cargo shorts. This is a pity, as I find the extra pockets useful for things like phones, change, and hard candy. But I've seen pictures of myself in cargos, and I look like someone who can't get a fucking job. Once past college age, I think you're at the time where you must wear standard shorts without cargo pockets, particularly if you're fat.

 Aside: When I was in school, my mom used to buy all my clothes (shocking, I know). She usually made fine choices, but occasionally she'd bring home something completely fucking outlandish. And the worst thing she ever brought me was a pair of Hugo Boss jorts. They were very baggy, hung below the knee, and the word BOSS was emblazoned in gold thread along the back bottom of the legs. I swear to God, I have never seen an uglier piece of clothing in my life. I almost burned them in front of her. They were returned.

Or is it my subconscious just yearning for the sweet relief of death?

<p>
 It means you're just scared of someone slitting your throat in the back of a car. Perfectly understandable. Remember, when you see that sort of thing in movies, the person in the front seat NEVER ends up avoiding death. They get fucking iced, and that is why you picture it likewise. Think of Carlo in

 If I'm driving at night, and the road is deserted, I constantly picture some madman and/or Mafioso springing up in the rearview and taking my goddamn head off. And that's when I start singing happy dance music to scare them away. CAN'T READ MY, CAN'T READ MY, NO HE CAN'T READ MY POKERRRR FACE!

  Lately, whenever I'm in the passenger seat of a car and the door is visibly unlocked, I've been getting these almost irresistible urges to open the door in traffic. Sometimes I try to inch my hand as near to the handle as I can get without anyone noticing. Eventually, if the ride is long enough, I'll just lock the door (onlookers be damned!) and yank the handle to my heart's content. Am I alone in this?

 I had a friend in grade school whose family had a van with a sliding door, and he always opened the door and liked to drag his foot along the road. AND HIS FUCKING MOM LET HIM! Oh, that's good 80's parenting.

 If I'm in a car and there's a biker or pedestrian coming up, I have to fight the urge to open the door just as I get to them, completely ruining their shit. I mean, that is just such a nasty move.

 Last thing: when I'm parked on a street and my door is on the street side, I'm always horrified that, when I open my door, some car will come speeding from out of nowhere and take the thing right off. There's clearly enough room on the road to accommodate my open door. But that doesn't mean it CAN'T happen. FLYING DOOR!

 I concur. When I was kid, I assumed every candy bar I ate might contain some kind of secret golden ticket, a potential prize not even mentioned on the wrapper. I never found such a ticket. But I did get to eat any number of 100 Grand bars.
</p>
<p>
 That tour is the height of children's candy porn. And the reason why is because, when I was kid, there was no more thrilling sight that that of a buffet. Yes, this was because I was a fat kid. But, to any kid, the sight of a real buffet is like stumbling upon the fucking treasure room in King Tut's tomb. My grandparents once took me to this place that had a giant dessert buffet. Every fucking dessert you could imagine: ice creams, cakes, pies, puddings, trifles, jello, tarts, tortes. Everything. It was, like, twenty yards long. My head nearly exploded. I didn't even know where to start. I went back 900 times. Being a kid and seeing a buffet is like being an adult and having Megan Fox spread out naked in your bedroom. Only the desserts don't talk.
</p>
<p>
 Ever go somewhere as a kid that had a dessert cart? Is there a shrewder piece of salesmanship than the dessert cart? It's one thing to see the chocolate ganache torte described on the menu. But now, here it comes on a wheeled cart for your viewing pleasure. So very, very close. You can almost taste it. Like I'm not ordering off a fucking dessert cart. I want to hijack the thing very time I see one. I wish my car were a dessert cart.

 Well, lets' see. A male silverback can grow to 440 lbs. And, according to some random thing over at Yahoo Answers:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  It should be sufficient to say that anecdotal evidence of animals observed almost casually bending and snapping objects such as tempered steel bars (2 inches thick) and giant bamboo stalks, suggest that the gorilla has the muscle power of between 8-15 men and possibly more. Jersey Zoos Jambo was observed to hang from one arm (he was over 400 lbs) while methodically ripping over 200 ft of inner ceiling planks from the roof of the new gorilla house with his other arm (the planks were securely screwed and nailed), simply because he didn't like them.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Goddamn. That's one strong monkey. I wish I had my DNA fused with a silverback. Then I could join the Marvel universe (SILVERBACK! THE MAN WITH APE STRENGTH!) and rob banks. If the gorilla has the power of over 15 men, you'll need an extra five or so to make sure it's held down. Then you need one more guy to strangle it while it's down to kill it. I have to think the first guy to reach the gorilla would get his head bashed in, so that's at least one casualty. But I think 21 guys would be able to do the trick. Remember: Steve Irwin only needed like, four other dudes to hold down a crocodile. Crocs are crazy strong. Not ape strong, but real fucking strong. No way you get it done with just three dudes. That would be a massacre. General Powell says the use of overwhelming force is required on Coco.

I say we've been friends for almost 15 years now, so we're all extremely comfortable with each other. And I seem to think that other people do this as well. Thoughts?

 Well, I went to prep school, so I'm not really a good arbiter of what constitutes getting gay with friends, since I am inherently gayer than most. We stuck our dicks in each other's ears. We had a thing called Naked Police, where everyone in the dorm ran naked into a freshman's room and just hung around and made him feel awkward. I made a point of sitting on the freshman's bed with my legs and cheeks spread as far wide as humanly possible.

 Also, I'd drop my pants in the common room, and thrust my hips violently so my dick would slap against my belly and back down. So I'm not really one to declare you "too gay".

  Do you ever go through a slump in your dumping life? Some weeks I'll be the world's best crapper, where twice a day I leave glorious turds and stand up feeling like I lost 10 pounds. And then there are weeks like this week, where no matter how at ease I am or how long I stay there, I am never satisfied with the results. Any suggestions on how to break this slump?

 Metamucil. I had to take a fiber supplement because it's supposed to help you lose weight and lower cholesterol, so now I take Metamucil thrice daily (I do the Pink Lemonade flavor, because it makes me feel like a KEWL KID). Anyway, since I started drinking that stuff, my shits have been pristine. I feel like I'm shitting out gold coins. It feels fantastic. Totally worth feeling like an old lump of shit for having Metamucil in your house.

 I have long prided myself on being a good and prolific shitter. I dunno why that's such a point of pride. Like, I view constipation as a character flaw. If I drop trou, I am not leaving that bathroom until I see brown, no matter how long I have to stay. To get off the pot without have excreted anything makes me feel like a fucking failure. Hasn't been a problem since Metamucil arrived on the scene. I feel like I'm taking HGH for my asshole.

  I work for an engineering company that specializes in designing plumbing layouts for office buildings, schools etc. We have been recommending our customers use this new toilet model called "The Champion 4" for some time now. It has gotten such good reviews that my boss decided to see what all the fuss was about, and installed one in our office bathroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the American Standard website: "The Champion will move a mass 70% larger than the industry standard. It achieves the highest bulk removal rating of 1,000 grams and will even flush a bucket of golf balls! Which means you can flush with confidence and never worry about plunging a toilet again."
 </p>

  Hear that? Flush with CONFIDENCE. Well, they aren't kidding. We've had a Champion in our office now for about a year, and I don't think it has clogged once. I've taken some massive coffee induced shits in this thing, and it flushes every time without fail. Unbelievable.
 </p>

  Found this video of a kid dumping all sorts of random objects into a Champion 4....bottom line, you can't defeat the Champ. That's some fine American toilet-design right there.

 HOLY SHIT. I want to flush a lobster down that thing.
