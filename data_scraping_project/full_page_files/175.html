  In the NFL, a delay of game penalty is a 5 yard penalty, and
the down is repeated. This essentially delays the game EVEN FURTHER (40 second
play clock; clock stopped to announce 5 yard penalty and repeat of down; 40
second play clock).  Why isn't delay of game a loss of down instead of 5
yards?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think it's because the NFL views the loss of a down as
truly punitive measure; one that should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  Downs are as valuable in football as outs are
in baseball.  It's one of the reasons
that intentional grounding is such an excellent penalty.  It's the rare penalty on a quarterback, and it
basically kills any drive because you lose the yards AND the down.  No other penalty crushes an offense as
mercilessly, not even holding.  Here now
is an arbitrary ranking of some basic NFL penalties, from most entertaining to
least:
</p>
<p>
 If you could somehow make a football game free of false
start and holding penalties, the sport would be 500% better.

  I work in the outdoor industry in Colorado.  One of my
colleagues &ndash; male, late twenties &ndash; has an Excel file which contains a variety
of different foods he has yet to try.  This list is fucking
ridiculous.  Included on this poor sap's list is: strawberries, watermelon,
mushrooms, grapes, lobster, crab and root beer floats.  How the fuck is
this possible?  He explains that he grew up in a small town outside
Columbus, OH and ate a lot of soup growing up.  I am obligated to bring
this man some of the deliciousness he has been missing out on, yes?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 "He grew up in a small town outside Columbus, OH and
ate a lot of soup growing up" might be the saddest passage in the history
of the English language.  You people
living in Ohio know you can leave, right? 
There's not a fucking wall around the state.  It's not
 <em>
  Dark
City
 </em>
 .  Do Ohioans even know of the
outside world, or do they just think the state border is a giant cliff edge,
with the blackness of outer space lying just beyond?
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, if you've ever been around a terrible food person,
you know how enraging they can be.  I
worked in an office once where they ordered lunch for everyone every day (it
was really nice of them), but we had some mouth-breathing idiot who always
complained whenever we chose some "exotic" shit like Indian
food.  He wouldn't eat the chicken tikka
because it had green sauce on it, and it took everything in my power to not
shove his face down in the plate and scream
 <em>
  WHAT
THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?  WHAT ARE
YOU, FIVE?!
 </em>
 I know foodies are
extremely annoying people, but a fully grown adult should have at least a
mildly educated palate.  It's 2013.  If you're an adult and you still find sushi
gross because "OMG raw fish!" you're a fucking bumpkin.  I want nothing to do with you.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, these people tend to be intractable, so there's no
point in forcing this poor bastard to try grapes because he'll just say "Ewwww
gross!" and then you'll want to pull his tongue out.  Don't bother trying to be his food DJ.  It won't work.

 <p>
  My dad called me into his room the other night and told me
that he needed a minor arm surgery and that he would be in a sling for a little
while and wouldn't be able to drive for a week. While obviously concerned about
his health, I happily realized that meant I would be able to drive his car for
the week. Am I a terrible person?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Nah.  It's arm
surgery.  It's not life threatening.  If it's not life-threatening, you don't have
to be THAT concerned.  It's like when a
friend tells me they have to go to the doctor and I'm like OMG ARE YOU OKAY
I'LL BE YOUR KID'S GUARDIAN IF YOU DIE. 
And then they're like, "I just have to get a hangnail removed"
and then I don't care at all anymore.  Screw
you for getting me worried over nuthin'.
</p>
<p>
 Even when serious things happen, you WILL have selfish
thoughts and you'll hate that they're there. 
But it's okay to have those feelings when you know you don't want
them.  If you just brazenly didn't give a
shit about bad things happening to your loved ones, that would make you a
shitty person.  But the average person
can be both concerned and privately selfish all at the same time.  The feelings aren't mutually exclusive to one
another.  Grief and worry are fluid
emotions.  So take that old man's car and
wrap it around a tree.  You've earned it!

 <p>
  A gay guy who I used to work with (I am straight and 24
years old) left his job last week to work as a manager for one of the big
department stores at a nearby mall. I didn't know him too well apart from the
occasional small talk, but he did seem like a pretty cool guy. Within minutes
after walking out the door, he sends me a text telling me that he thought I was
attractive and that he'd like to hang out with me. Of course I had to tell him
that I was into chicks but would still have a beer with him sometime. He agreed
and also told me he would invite me to one of his parties. Now I would imagine
that this guy has some pretty attractive girl friends. If this is the case,
would it be out of line to ask him to introduce me to one of them at one of his
parties, especially knowing that he is attracted to me?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It's not out of line, but consider how men operate.  Even when a girl you like tells you that you
have no shot, you'll still TRY.  You'll
still hang around on the off chance that she decides one day&mdash;out of the blue&mdash;to
get naked with you.  That's how men work.  Any time a girl turned me down in high school
or college, I would still pull a Lloyd Christmas and be like
 <em>
  but
 </em>
 <em>
  what
if she gets hit in the head and has amnesia and suddenly decides she wants to
bone HIGH FIVE it could happen bro
 </em>
 . 
Every rejection is seen as only temporary, and NOTHING&mdash;not even the
bounds of sexual orientation&mdash;will deter a man.
</p>
<p>
 So it's entirely possible that your new gay friend is hoping
beyond hope that maybe you change your mind. 
He might invite you to the party and even hook you up with a couple of
cat ladies, but at some point, he'll probably be like, "So, are you sure
we can't fuck?  Because I'm still open to
it!"  It's just our nature.  SHAME ON YOU FOR LEADING HIM ON, GOOD SIR.

<blockquote>
 <p>
  If the average person were to take over play calling for an
NFL offense with the sole goal of getting stats for their fantasy football
team, would their fantasy team be better off? Essentially quality vs. quantity.
Sure Calvin Johnson could get targeted 40 times (only a slight increase from
reality, I know), but would it matter because of the play caller's
inexperience and lack of knowledge, as well as the fact that the defense might
start catching on the same player getting the ball every play?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It would almost certainly have an adverse effect on your fantasy
team because you know next to nothing about how to call a decent football
game.  Even the absolute worst offensive
coordinator usually tries to get the ball to his best players anyway.  Occasionally, you'll have an asshole like
Mike Shanahan pop up&mdash;a coach who is seemingly determined not to ride the hot
hand&mdash;but even those guys will probably help your fantasy player out more than
you will.  Because you'll be unable to
resist temptation and give your running back fifty carries a game, resulting in
0.7 yards per carry and a terrible back injury. 
You need coordinators interested in actual football outcomes to help
keep things balanced.

 <p>
  Is there a fantasy team somewhere out there that is exactly
the same as yours? This includes your bench. I mean there are millions of
fantasy football teams, there's just gotta be one out there right?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It's more unlikely than you think.  For example, my fantasy team (which lost the
fucking title game because they SUCK) had fifteen spots on the roster: a
starting QB, 2 RBs, 2 WRs, 1 TE, 1 D/ST, 1 WR/RB, and six bench spots to do
with as I saw fit.  So take the pool of
starting fantasy QBs (15 or so?), multiply that by the pool of RB1s (dozens),
RB2s (ditto), WR1 and WR2s (ditto ditto), TE's (plenty of those), kickers (32),
defenses (32), and every possible permutation of the six bench players.  Even without the bench players, your starting
lineup is something like one out of 386 billion potential combinations.  The bench players jack that up
exponentially.  So no else likely has my lineup
of Drew Brees and C.J. Spiller and Alf Morris and Tim Wright and Jordy Nelso OH
GOD WHY DID AARON RODGERS HAVE TO GET HURT FOR SEVEN GAMES AND RUIN JORDY WHY
GOD WHY I HATE YOU ALL.  Your fantasy
team is yours and yours to hate alone.

  If you could suck your own dick, and assuming you gave
yourself a mean blowy, how often would you do it?  Would you consider it a
talent?  Do you keep it a secret?  Tell your closest bros after a few
beers?  I was going to apply for an internship here but now that seems
like that's out of the question.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 We'd still hire you. 
Anyway, any man that could blow himself would.  I have dreams about this.  And whenever I dream about it, I'm always
doing it IN PUBLIC, which kind of makes the whole thing a nightmare.  I have my pants off and I'm just going to
town at the bus station, and then I wake up and have to reassure myself that no
one saw me sucking my own dick.
</p>
<p>
 I dunno why I can't dream about doing it alone in a motel
room because if I could do it in real life I would tell exactly NO ONE.  I don't know if that's due to latent homophobia
or just a general sense of shame, but you best believe I would keep it to
myself.  And I would tell myself, every
day, "All right, Drew.  This is the
LAST time we do this."  And then I would
do it again and again and again.  If
there's a convenient and pleasurable way of handling your business, you'll use
it.  What man dares resist himself?  But I wouldn't swallow.  I'm not that kind of girl.

 <p>
  I currently am a student on a dry campus. It sucks. I'm 22
and still have to maintain the bullshit rules even in my apartment. Getting the
booze in isn't a problem with backpacks but getting it out is getting
cumbersome. You can't just walk out to the dumpster or the trash room with a
few 18 packs or a few bourbon bottles in a suitcase and get to emptying. Any
suggestion on how to get rid of the dead soldiers in the least conspicuous way
possible?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I would say FIND A NEW COLLEGE but that's dickish and
impractical, and more and more colleges are trying to ban alcohol from campus
to prevent alcohol-related deaths.  Right
after I graduated from college, a girl got shitfaced and fell out of a dorm window
and the booze rules at my alma mater got more restrictive.  And I'm sure plenty of guys there were like
 <em>
  This is bullshit, bro!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 The problem is that so many kids go to college specifically
TO drink (I know that's why I went), so much so that making a campus dry
usually causes kids to break the rules (fun!) or take all their drinking off
campus, which can lead to even more drunk driving and general harm.  I drank a lot in school and now I'm just
another parent who is scared SHITLESS that I will end up spending $50K a year
for my kid to go die of fucking alcohol poisoning.
</p>
<p>
 There's no great solution to this because nothing gets
college kids more riled up than when their ability to drink and/or smoke weed
is somehow hindered.  FUCKING FREEDOM OF
SPEECH AND SHIT.  I talked to someone who
worked at a college once about trying to prevent alcohol-related deaths and
they just looked utterly helpless.  Ban
every possible avenue to booze and your school is suddenly Oral Roberts.  No one wants that.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, if you can sneak booze in a backpack, why couldn't
you sneak it out the same way?  And then
go dump it in a lake.  That's giving back
to the earth!

 <p>
  Which part of a bagel is more satisfying to eat, the top or
the bottom? I know some people put the cream cheese the middle then put it back
together like a sandwich. I don't believe in this philosophy.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The top.  The top has
more shit on it.  It's crunchier.  And it's usually less doughy, so you can eat
the top of a bagel only and feel like you somehow made a healthy choice even
though half a bagel has roughly 7,000 calories. 
Ever get a bagel that's been split unevenly, so that you get a really thick
bottom (hee hee hee) and a really thin top? 
It's awful.  I want to start all
over again.  The precious balance has
been destroyed.
</p>
<p>
 (By the way, I recently was part of a "Is a bagel with
lox and cream cheese a sandwich?" argument, and I couldn't pick a side because,
to me, a bagel is a sandwich only if you eat it when it's put back together,
and not with two open faced halves, which is how I prefer to eat it.  A bagel is sandwidexterous.)

 <p>
  Sometimes when I'm at work or a store or something, I'll see
another person, and I suddenly get this urge to body-check them into a wall or
shove them. Just random attacks with no motivation. Or I'll see some woman and
my brain will go "You should grab her ass". It's like my mind is
trying to play some kind of practical joke on me. Is this a thing that happens
to other guys, or am I crazy? For what it's worth, I've NEVER once
actually acted on these urges.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well that's just it. 
If you don't act on them, they don't mean anything.  It's hard to even call it an urge, because an
urge feels more like something that compels you to act.  Sometimes, you'll just walk around and have a
fucking completely stupid thought.  I
used to walk around Central Park and think about hitting people in the head
with a hammer and then running away.  THE
HAMMER BANDIT.  I didn't WANT this
thought.  I didn't like it.  I didn't will it to be.  It's just your mind brainstorming.

we killed everyone here!  Hey, what if we
drove off that embankment together?  Oh
hey, a knife!  You could plunge that into

 I get all those
terrible little germs in my brain, but I never act on them.  I assume it's normal to see those ideas flash
across your brain.  At least, it's normal
for you and I.  Maybe we're just complete
lunatics.  If so, I would like to
congratulate us for not murdering anyone else. 
Took real restraint!

  I saw a ladybug on my lamp this evening and instinctively
knew to kill it because I vaguely remember one "pissing" on me when I
was a kid, and it hurt.  I decided to look it up, and yup: ladybugs
"typically release a small amount of blood from their legs. (This is
called reflex bleeding)."
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Seriously?  That's
true?  Come on, man.  Don't ruin the one insect with whom I have a
relatively good relationship.  Ladybugs
are supposed to be gentle and friendly, and so COLORFUL!  Every time I see one crawling around on the
wall, I run to my kids and I'm like LADYYYYBUGGGG!  LET'S ALL GO SEE!  And then I pluck the ladybug off the wall
(half the time I kill it by accident and everyone is sad) and then hand it to
my kid and she puts it in a jar with two blades of grass and then it dies 10 minutes later.  It's a really nice
thing.  Don't ruin it by telling me that
ladybugs want to piss hot cobra blood all over me.

<p>
 I have a decent working relationship with only a handful of
bugs, and I hope to build on them.  Here

around on one of those Family Watchdog sites (Don't ask me why. It's not like
we have kids or currently have the desire to) and I click on the image, it's
the super.  He was convicted in the early 90s in New York for Third Degree
Sodomy.  Do I tell her about this? Do I try to scrub it from my mind? This
guy has access to our apartment and has helped us out of a jam dozens of times.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 There's no scrubbing it from your mind.  It's gonna pop into your head every time you
see him&mdash;you'll get a VIVID mental image of him perpetrating the crime&mdash;and
you're gonna have to decide if you like him and trust him enough to live with
that and NOT tell your girlfriend. 
Because once the girlfriend knows, you're moving.  Women don't fuck around like that.  They don't sit around and pick their butts
like men.  They ACT.  So if you want to stay where you are and keep
your brilliant pederast super, you'll just have to keep it to yourself.  The good news is that you don't have
children, and you aren't children yourselves. 
Which means if he decides that he must again act on his demented,
horrible impulses, he won't sodomize YOU. 
And that's a win-win for everyone!

 <p>
  When my daughter wants to out to the garage and ride her
tricycle around in circles for about 2 hours, I often shoot hoops on her Little
Tykes 3-foot hoop. I'm out there so much that I now shoot about 99 percent from
the field now. I can't fucking miss.
 </p>
 <p>
  It got me thinking: If the NBA decided to keep all court
dimensions the same but lowered the hoop to 3 feet off the ground, how would
the game change? Would LeBron still be the best player in the NBA, or would
Nate Robinson suddenly have this enormous advantage?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It would essentially destroy the height advantage that NBA
players have over one another.  If you
don't have to go vertical to get to the basket and you couldn't shoot over
people (you couldn't shoot at all, really, since every shot would be blocked),
the game would essentially boil down to muscling your way to the hoop
(something LeBron James is still quite good at, of course) and stuffing it in
from point-blank range.  Trash can
football, basically.  The game would evolve
into a contact sport with pads and more compact personnel and you would
probably hate it.
</p>
<p>
 I'm like Ryan in that my kids have a toy basketball hoop,
and sometimes I'll nail a bunch of jumpers in a row and think to myself...
 <em>
  You know
what?  I can do this.  I was a late bloomer but I have the touch
now.  I could really make it in the

 Then my kid will bitch that
I'm hogging the ball and I'll have to explain to him that Daddy needs the ball
because he has the better technique.

<p>
 I think it would take a great deal longer than 10,000
years.  It would probably take millions
of years, well after humanity has cleared out of the joint and a whole new

Frankly, I don't think it will be the evolution of any current animal,
but a repulsive mutated lizard race borne out of an altered climate and human
chemical pollution.  Godzilla,

  My mother used to lock up all the snacks/treats in a
basement cabinet when I was a child.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many years ago, my mom forgot the combo to the lock;
and the cabinet in the basement storage room simply sat there, unattended, for
years.  Mom then sadly passed away after a bout with cancer two years
ago. This Christmas, when we were all in the house to spend the holiday with my
father, we decided that we had to know what was in there.  Fully preserved
and edible Fruit Roll Ups?  Cockroaches?   Kudos bars?  Dead
rats? WE HAD TO KNOW.
 </p>
 <p>
  We had a neighbor bring over his bolt cutters, and we
snapped that lock right in half. Aunts and uncles, cousins, and friends
were gathered around in the basement....waiting in anticipation. We found
(picture attached) some pop tart minis, a bag of Ruffles, and a pair of
candlesticks (????). The food had no expiration dates listed, but there was a copyright
date of 1994 on the Pop Tart box.  On a dare, my cousin Kevin ate one.
 By what incremental factor did he damage his body (over eating a
"fresh" pop tart)?  I think the 2-decade old Pop Tart did 6X
incremental damage to him.
