 The latter.  Honestly,
we should have a threat level chart for these games.  ORANGE means a journalist has been
poisoned.  RED means that a bunch of gay
athletes are about to be detained and put on a boxcar to Irkutsk.  PURPLE means a ski chalet is about to fall on
everyone because contractors pocketed the construction money and made it out of
old pasta.

know that there have been plenty of other instances in the past&mdash;Athens, most

lax security and openly asked about moving the event, but this feels roughly
700 times more ominous.  It's

is about to come due.  I obviously hope
nothing bad happens, because that would be awful.  But I ain't exactly CONFIDENT.

That's the amazing thing about the Olympics or the NCAA or any other horseshit

  Why is it that, literally every time there is a pile up from
a fumble, at least one player (who isn't even involved in the play) will signal
that their team recovered the ball, regardless of the fact that he has no clue
who has it?  Do they think this actually means anything?  It's not
like the ref will just say, "Well, I don't know who has it, but Johnny Dipshit
is pointing down the field so we'll just give them the ball!"
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Yeah, but it never hurts to TRY.  If you don't know who the hell has the ball,
you may as well try to intimidate the ref by angrily sticking your hand
out.  And the best part is that the announcers
ALWAYS fall for it!  "The Seahawks
are signaling that they have the ball." 
That means nothing.  All that does
is give me, the viewer at home, the false hope that my team recovered the ball,
and then the ref signals otherwise and I want to blow a hole in the sun and
kill us all.
</p>
<p>
 Fumble recoveries are notoriously lucky plays, which makes
it doubly annoying when the team you hate recovers its own fumble, and it's
even more enraging when they then advance that fumble for a score or first down.  They should make any fumbled ball result in
an automatic turnover, regardless of who recovers*.  That way, the butterfingers responsible gets
MAXIMUM SHAME and I don't have to sit there hoping that the backup tight end
had a really great vantage point of the pile when he signaled OUR BALL to the
ref.

  What would happen if the Super Bowl went to overtime and
nobody scored? Ignore the statistical improbability of this ever happening.
Let's say the game went into OT, and then double OT, and then triple OT, and so
on, with nobody scoring. At what point does Goodell step in and do something?
Does he eventually phone down to the refs and have them bullshit some reason
for an automatic safety? Does he postpone the game and schedule it to continue
the following week? I feel like that would be a logistical train wreck. Does he
just insist the game continue until it's 7AM and a fourth-string
Tight End is the only one left healthy enough to play, allowing him to walk to
ball into the end zone

  -style?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think about this any time any game that cannot end in a
tie (college football game, NFL playoff game, any basketball game, any baseball
game) heads into overtime.  I imagine a
 <em>
  Twilight Zone
 </em>
 -style rift opening in the
space-time continuum and players trapped for years and years in an unwinnable
sporting event.  I think that, if that
ever happened, the Ginger Hammer would step in after a set amount of time&mdash;call
it 18 hours of gameplay&mdash; and either a) declare the game a tie or b) order a
rest and then either replay the game (second Super Bowl!) or have centuple
overtime be continued at a later date.  You
already saw the former option exercised at the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

 </a>
 game (after just 11 innings of play!).  As much as we all love sports, there are
natural human limits to how long you'd like to watch a game and/or how long you
would like to participate in one.  Drama
dissipates and fatigue eventually sets in. 
And the older you get, the less tolerance you have.  There are times when I dread watching
overtime because I'm already fucking tired, even when it's a legitimately good
game.  JUST END IT, ALREADY.  And then I feel bad for not being Mr. Super
Sports Fan.

  What if the NFL installed the following rule: A player can
only attempt
  <em>
   one
  </em>
  FG per game? How
many kickers do you roll with and when do you send them out there? I myself
would get all fired up to watch a fat lineman try and boot a 50-yarder with the
game on the line.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think you would still keep one kicker on the roster and
save your good kicker for the end of the game, when you really need to make a
kick.  For the rest of the game, you're
probably either going for it on 4th down or bringing in a platoon of position
players who have practiced booting field goals from close in.  You'd NEVER attempts a field goal longer
than, say, twenty-five yards in that instance. 
Verdict: IMPROVEMENT.
</p>
<p>
 I know kickers complain when people think about ways to
phase kickers out of football, but sorry, gents: We really do want you out of
the sport.  I'm willing to try pretty
much anything to make it happen.

  Do you ever see there being another civil war in the US? If
so, what do you think the cause would be?

<p>
 Richard Sherman would be the cause.  Those who would abolish Richard Sherman will
soon take up arms.
</p>
<p>
 Obviously, since mankind will come to an end at some point,
so will the United States.  That's just
the way it works.  This shit won't last
forever... it's just a question of how we fuck it all up and how quickly we can
do so.  You're unlikely to ever see
another clear cut, official Civil War break out in America a) we're lazy and b) we're far too intermingled.  There are
filthy liberals in Texas.  There are gun
nuts in upstate New York.  We're too
spread out now to coalesce into easily opposed territories: North vs. South, East
Coast vs. West Coast, Everyone vs. Florida, etc.
</p>
<p>
 Now, the dissolution of the United States will happen in
some other way.  For example, the sea
levels will rise, and New York City will be submerged underwater, and then
millions of displaced New Yorkers will migrate south to North Carolina open
$50,000-a-year nursery schools and artisanal cheese shops, and then locals will
get tired of accommodating all these asshole refugees, build a wall, and declare
Carolina its own sovereign state or something. 
That's how it will go down.  All
of the shit that supposedly divides us now&mdash;guns, religion, arguments about the
HOMOSECKSHOOLS, etc.&mdash;are essentially luxury items.  It'll only be when disaster strikes and we're
forced to horde all our sheep and water that we will truly split apart, strictly
as a matter of survival.  I give it eight
years.

 Joe:

<blockquote>
 <p>
  So the NFL is killing its players. So much so that they want
to extend the season to 18 games. How about this for a short-term solution:
Shorten the games to 12 or even 10 minutes/quarter. You spare the players up to
33% of the season's wear and tear (per game). You're not making a fundamental
rule change (at least as to how the game looks as an on-field product). Because
the league is now more of a passing league anyway, it will actually bring the
game closer to the old days in terms of number of plays, possessions, and
drives.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 You'll never see the NFL do that because they'll never do
anything that makes the record book inconsistent.  They cater to a sporting public that loves
nothing more than to have un-resolvable arguments about which player from one
era is better than some other asshole from some other era.  As long as the parameters of the game remain
fairly consistent, you can maintain the illusion that these arguments can be
solved by looking at the stats.  When you
make a fundamental change to the game clock, you basically reset the record
book.  Every single passing, rushing, and
receiving stat from there on out will be incomparable to some stat from the
60-minute clock era, and I think Roger Goodell would hate that strictly for
aesthetic reasons, even if
I'd be perfectly all right with a 48-minute football game.  Plus you lose an hour of ads (or, more
likely, the NFL ADDS another hour of ads to keep the games 210 minutes long).
</p>
<p>
 This is the reason (apart from money, of course) that
baseball will never go back to the 154-game schedule, and why the NHL and NBA
will never shorten their respective seasons. 
They have too much invested in statistical consistency to mess with the
formula.  The only way we can get them to
make sensible, drastic rule changes?  You
guessed it: CIVIL WAR II.

 For the singular achievement of racking up 27 penalty minutes in one second of ice time, Canucks&hellip;
</p>
<p>
 It's not a matter of douchebaggery (although Olbermann has
demonstrated it in spades), it's more an example of Olbermann having no self-control.  Twitter is the great equalizer in that it
shows you which celebrities are smart enough to avoid beefing with total
strangers, and which are crazy enough to take every single piece of trollbait thrown
their way, as if they can, by sheer force of will, get everyone who does not
like them to change their minds, which is impossible.  Like, Keith Olbermann is a famous guy with
millions of dollars.  How on Earth is he
getting bogged down in Twitter fights with a pre-teens?  On a certain level, he has to love those
beefs, because he must be smart enough to know that they can't be WON.
</p>
<p>
 No one has ever walked away from a Twitter beef being like,
"Boy, I'm real glad that happened! 
That really helped shape me as a person."  I've gotten in more than my fair share of
message board fights and the reason you get into them is because the other
person is there to provide a bag for you to punch, and vice versa.  If you take it a REAL disagreement, as
opposed to a mutually agreed upon Monty Python argument sketch, then you're
screwed.  I've gotten emotionally
invested.  I've fallen in hate.  You always end up feeling like a moron.

 <p>
  I'm 30 years old now and am wondering whether or not I'm too
old to still have a pierced nipple. I had it done back when I was 19 because my
girlfriend at the time thought it would be hot. Should I leave it in or take it
out forever? Keep in mind that: 1. It hurt like hell to get it done 2. My
nipple would look odd, like awkward and not like my other non-pierced
nipple.  People are surprised when they
see it at the lake/beach/pool as I am otherwise piercing and tattoo-free. When
am I too old?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 God, that really must have hurt.  Did fluid leak out of the nipple when you had
it done?  Like milk?  Have you ever caught the piercing on
something?  Because the idea of ripped
skin makes me shit basketballs. SO MUCH PAIN. 
My kid wants her ears pierced and I keep telling her, "Hey, you
know they drive a spike through both of your ears, right?  You know it hurts, yes?  Because you act like Satan is being purged
from you when I go to take a splinter out."  This is why I have no piercings: Because I am
scared of pain.
</p>
<p>
 ANYWAY, if you're already thinking about being too old for
your piercing, it's probably a good sign that you should go ahead and remove
it.  You should be
 <em>
  confident
 </em>
 in your pierced nipple. 
You should be able to look at your nipple in the mirror every morning
and be like YEAH JEETS.  I ain't one to
judge.  If you think it looks good and it
gives you a bit more confidence to rock some nipple jewelry, you do what
works.  But if part of you thinks it
might look ridiculous, you may as well ditch the hardware, because I think it's
a very small portion of the general population that looks at a man and goes,
"God, if he ONLY had a ring dangling from his titty, he'd be
perfect."
</p>
<p>
 And if your nips look weird with it out, just grow more
chest hair.  Or tell women that you were
born with a "winking nipple," which is a sign of good fortune.  Men shouldn't even have nipples.  Mine get all goosebumpy when it's cold
out.  It's very embarassing.

  Let's say you're mega rich and you buy a NFL team.  So
rich that you pay for the team in cash.  So rich that after you buy the
team, you announce that you're going to: a) build a new stadium using only your
own money; b) hold an annual lottery for season tickets ($30 for the best
seats, less for nosebleeds, all seats go back into the pool every year) with no
PSL's; c) provide free parking; d) sell beers and hot dogs for $1; etc. 
Basically, you run the team as a break-even business, truly earn the
"public interest" designation the league claims, and generally just
say "Fuck You" to the other owners by openly shaming them for their
selfishness and greed.

<p>
 Nah.  They would just
sit you down and tell you that you're an idiot. 
No rich person pays for things if they can get some other asshole to pay
for it, and that's how NFL teams work.  I
went to buy a car a while back and I had planned to pay for as much of the car
up front as possible, because I don't understand finance and I don't like owing
people money or paying interest or any of that shit.  Anyway, the finance guy was like, "Dude,
don't spend this money if you don't have to. 
Just take this loan and then use that money for beer."  And he was right!  Or I was totally suckered into paying 2% interest
for three years!  Either way, I bet
Goodell would sit you down and tell you to take the bank's money for the team
and the stadium and keep your extra billion or so to throw yacht orgies.  And you would LISTEN, because no man can
resist yacht orgies.
</p>
<p>
 If I had the money to buy an NFL team, I'd go in with the
best of intentions, like you said.  I'd
try to pay for the stadium in cash, only to eventually take the sweetheart
loan.  I'd try to sell hot dogs for a
dollar, only to get complaints from the vendors about low profit margins.  I'd try to keep ticket prices low, only to
see them pop up on StubHub of $500 each. 
I'd try to do everything right, only to end up resenting all of the fans
I'm trying to help.  Then I'd turn evil
and charge everyone $500 for parking.  It
happens to all of them.  They all end up

<p>
 This is why your cable bill has been and always will be a
bundled package deal.  If you could elect
to NOT pay for SPEED Channel, you'd drop it immediately. I already watch less
TV because of the Internet, so this would cut down my viewing even
further.   It's been said elsewhere, but live sports is
really the only thing keeping you tethered to your cable bill.  The rest you can just buy ala carte on iTunes
or whatever.  If the NFL ever decided to
sell some kind of streaming package that wasn't tied to a satellite or cable
provider (through Roku or something), the TV industry would essentially
die.  This is why Roger Goodell can
charge networks a billion dollars a year and then go run a Red Zone channel
free of advertising.  He may as well
