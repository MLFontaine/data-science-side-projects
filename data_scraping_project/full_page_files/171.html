  Any tips on surviving a day of air travel - two flights and a layover - with a three-and-a-half-year-old and a two-month-old? Let's assume sedation isn't an option for the children (or adults) involved, and we'd ideally like to keep our marriage and custodial rights intact.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I assume the 2-month-old is a lap child, right? A kid under 2 can fly free with you so long as you keep them on your lap (and you have a copy of a valid birth certificate, and those fuckers at the counter won't hesitate to give you the shit eye when you've forgotten it). Keeping a lap baby with you for an entire flight is every bit as excruciating as you think it is. But buying an extra seat is an impossible luxury, so you just have to deal with it the best you can. The upside is that the baby almost always wants mommy on an airplane and not you (unless
 <em>
  you're
 </em>
 the mommy, in which case my condolences), which means you get to deal with the older child, who is easier and has his own seat.
</p>
<p>
 As for older kids ... iPads and iPhones. That's a shitty piece of advice to throw out when not everyone has an iPad (I don't know how so many people have them when they cost so fucking much), but if you have a screen for the kids to stare at and you have snacks and you have a couple of books and you get up and walk the aisle a couple of times, you should be able to establish a kind of airplane training circuit for the kid: screen time, eating, reading, walking, screen time, eating, reading, walking, and repeat. This requires you to take enough kiddie supplies to fit inside a U.S. Army canvas deployment bag, and the one item that you need will ALWAYS be at the bottom of the fucking bag, leaving you hunched over in agony for hours at a time. But you have no choice.
</p>
<p>
 All of this is substantially easier when you bring a car seat an board and strap the 2- or 3-year-old in it, but that requires bringing the car seat through customs (along with the Army bag), then getting it onto the plane and installing it while 200 people boarding behind you MURDER you with their eyes as you struggle with the seat belt. It's a pick-your-poison scenario, frankly. You're a dead man either way. Just keep lots of screens and unhealthy shit to eat close at hand.

  Have penises become larger over the course of history? I am
taking a Greek Mythology class and our professor shows us power points of arts
of the Gods and other significant figures and all of them have very small
dicks. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I recollected the statue of
David, history's most iconic penis, and how undersized his is depicted as.
Couldn't he have had the artist exaggerate? Or was penis size just not a
concern? But it had to be, right? All these Greek Gods and Roman Emperors were
sex-obsessed and fucked nearly everything that moved. Didn't they see bigger
dicks as the enemy?? Dicks seem to be naturally bigger now. Or maybe we as a
society just watch too much porn. If dicks have gotten larger, what, in the
course of history, could have made them so?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well, over the
 <a href="http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1820836,00.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  past
century-plus
 </a>
 , we have grown larger as a species.  We are now taller and fatter than we were 140
years ago because we eat more and because we are less prone to contracting
crippling hunchback diseases.  I've been
to museums and looked at suits of olde tymey plate mail armor and those suits
always look like they were designed for the petite section at Ann Taylor.  So, if we're bigger overall as a species,
then it would stand to reason that our dicks are larger, no?  And I bet bigger-donged men are getting more
action and making more babies with their big dicks and birthing a larger
segment of the dick-rocking population, right?
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps not!  Turns out
that there have been
 <a href="http://www.divinecaroline.com/love-sex/big-hands-big-feet-big-penis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  numerous
studies
 </a>
 comparing body size to penis size, and, "They found that age
and body characteristics were not associated with size of penis except for the
'index finger length' ..."  Which
means that Pedro Martinez must be hung like a fucking grandfather clock.  Now, if we've grown overall as a species in
the past 140 years, maybe it would stand to reason that our index fingers are a
little bit bigger, which means our dicks are a little bit bigger.  But you and I know full well that there are
large men with small dicks and small men with large dicks.  I looked when in the high school gym shower.  I'm not made of stone!  You can only keep curiosity at bay for so
long, dammit!  If our penises have grown
over the course of history, it's probably not by a significant measure.  You won't be able to comfort yourself at
night knowing that you are more capable at deep dicking than your
ancestors.  Sorry, amigo.
</p>
<p>
 I would like to get a proper measurement of my own apparatus
one day.  When I was a kid, I used to
sneak downstairs in the middle of the night and try to measure my boner with a
ruler, but the reading was never optimal. 
I used to really jam that thing down into the root, too, for maximum
length.  I need a professional
length-assessment service that provides both customary and metric measurements
for me to put on insurance forms. 
"Whoa, this guy is a full six and two-thirds!  APPROVE THAT LOAN."

  Justin Bieber's recent legal problems don't seem to have
diminished the degree to which his biggest fans (Beliebers) adore him. What
would he need to do to lose their affection? Murder? Rape? Chris Brown,
arguably a peer of his, beat the crap out of his girlfriend, a pop star in her
own right, and his biggest fans didn't miss a beat. I think Justin would have
needed to crash his Lamborghini into a bus full of nuns before his Twitter
tally dropped.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I don't think even that would turn off die-hard
Beliebers.  If you're that emotionally
invested in an artist or a movie star or something like that, you'll concoct
any reason to justify your habit.
 <em>
  He's just a kid!  He needs help!  The media are out to get him!  Those nuns were throwing themselves at him!  WHORES.
 </em>
 Stuff like that.  I mean, it's not
that different from my enjoyment of the NFL. 
Roger Goodell could stand on a podium this week and club a fetal pony to
death and I'd still watch football.
</p>
<p>
 The only thing that will diminish the whole Belieber frenzy
is time.  Kids are fucking insane about
the things they like.  I was no different.  When I was a kid and Def Leppard got knocked
off the top spot on Dial MTV, I would fucking FUME.  And if anyone ripped on Metallica in front of
me at school, I would get all huffy and be like, "You don't know shit
about anything JAMES HETFIELD IS A GENIUS AND U ARE A LOOZER!"  And if you were some girl who liked New Kids
on the Block, as far as I was concerned, you were the ENEMY.  I can't even imagine what an ass I would have
made of myself on the Internet at that age. 
When you're young, you love the things you love a whole lot more
irrationally than you do when you're older.
</p>
<p>
 So it'll all fade away at some point.  Bieber will keep getting into trouble and
making records and the fanbase will move on to other shit, with a few
stragglers left who grow up to be cat ladies. 
I worked with an old lady who kept a poster of Ricky Martin in her
office.  That's what a Bieber refugee
will look like twenty years from now.  The
rest will grow up into perfectly normal, well-adjusted people.  We all have our phases.

 Well, there was that brief dustup when M.I.A.
 <a href="http://deadspin.com/5882497/yes-mia-just-flipped-off-the-world" rel="nofollow">
  flipped the bird
 </a>
 during Madonna's set.  M.I.A. was fined $1.5
million by the NFL for the incident.  For
the record, that fine appears to be larger than
 <a href="http://www.nfl.com/photoessays/09000d5d827a273e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  any fine that the NFL
 </a>
 has ever handed down on a player or organization.  Spygate, Bountygate, Ndamukong Suh going
knee-hunting&mdash;all of that merited a lesser fine than a momentary bird flash
that you probably would have glanced right over if you didn't have a DVR.  Glad the NFL has its priorities in order.
</p>
<p>
 Eat your heart out, Janet. [NBC]
</p>
<p>
 That enormous fine was meant as a deterrent to any future
Super Bowl performer hoping to get away with such ME FIRST behavior.  I'm sure that Bruno Mars and the Chili
Peppers (I liked the Chili Peppers in high school, but I really don't ever need
to hear them do "Give It Away" with Mars) had to sign a stack of
lengthy, unreadable contracts that stipulate an unreasonable punishment should
either artist whip their dick out on stage: fines, jail, deportation, manual fingernail
removal, etc.  I bet Roger Goodell has
spent more time trying to prevent televised penises that he has brain damage.

<p>
 It's because
 <a href="http://go.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  go.com

 still acts
as the official domain for the Walt Disney Company corporate empire.  You can go there and find links to all of the

And since typing ESPN.com takes you to the same site anyway, it's probably
not that big of a deal, although I'm sure there's a "URL branding director"
in Bristol whose only job is to make sure that the network's domain names
contain the requisite amount of cross-promotion.

 Back in 1998, we had a computer lab at school and I would hop
in a few times a day (and often at night while drunk!  Everyone loves the drunk guy in the computer
lab!) to check out espn.sportszone.com (I found it using Infoseek!).  It took fucking AGES to load but I had no
fast Internet to compare it to back then, so I didn't give a shit.  Just five minutes of a page slowly unveiling
itself down the screen, like the world's dullest stripshow.  I adored it. 
You can find the old archived ESPN SportsZone pages at the national
Internet Archive.  Here's one

 <p>
  I go to a college with a prominent basketball team. I have a
friend that goes to a D-III college but is a fan of my school's main rival.
Every time we start shit talking about basketball, I will always bring up the
fact that I actually attend the college that I root for, and he always responds
by saying that he's been a lifelong fan and knows more about his team than I do
about mine, which admittedly is very true. I still win, right?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 You do.  Going to the
school is always the trump card, because I always assume that anyone who roots
for a college team but didn't attend that school was too stupid to get in.  And if you didn't want to attend that school
or you went to a better school, then why the fuck do you like them so much?
</p>
<p>
 This isn't really fair, given that all sports fandom is
pointless and irrational.  I haven't set
foot in Minnesota for over twenty years but I'm still a Vikings fan.  I'd never move back to Minnesota because it's
cold as shit there and I don't really know anyone there anymore.  I don't really walk the walk when it comes to
 <em>
  total area loyalty
 </em>
 .  I just like my team and stuck with it.  You could probably say the same about some
dipshit Bama fan that ended up in trucking school.  But this is sports.  If you can find a reason to dump on some
other group of fans, you do.  And so that
is why I say trucker school Bama fan is a bag of shit.

<blockquote>
 <p>
  If sex and general affection didn't feel good, how would the
dating process change?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It would cease existing. 
In general, sex is what gets men to leave the house.  If you're 22 and going out for the
night, you're going out for the night with the goal of getting laid.  Whether it's a date or a party or even a trip
to the grocery store, you leave the house thinking, "Hey, this might end
up with my penis in someone!" 
That's the motivation.  You know
what a chore it is to get fucking pants on? 
If that potential endgame were to be taken away, you'd never fucking go
out.  Men want sex first.  The whole friendship-and-camaraderie-and-general-enjoyment-of-a-woman's-company thing? That
comes after we've gotten our fill.
</p>
<p>
 We are such pathetic, disgusting animals sometimes. There are mornings I can barely look at myself
in the mirror. It's just me sitting there and saying to myself,
 <em>
  Welp I hope today isn't the day that my most obscene and disgusting
impulses don't come flying out of me!
 </em>
 Without that frantic, annoying desperation, sex would cease, men would
put bros even MORE before hoes, and the human race would die out in short
order.  Probably for the best if that
ever happens.  I think people might still
get married later in life though, just so they have someone to change the
bedpan.

 I always try to keep a level head whenever I imaginarily

gives the media honest quotes without being a showoff about it.

 Since my team actually fired their coach last month, I have
pictured myself as the owner of the team addressing the media after the firing

myself to the guys at minicamp ("Hi! 
I'm Drew-Mike Zimmergary.") and giving my first big all-hands
speech to the guys.  I have the speech all
set to go if I'm ever plucked to lead a football team despite having absolutely

uses that? Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I'd like to think Brady's frustratingly

<p>
 I'd like to think that once you reach a certain level of
fame and fortune, someone discreetly mails you some kind of special Hustler Black
card that gives you special access to diamond-level hookers online ready to
obey your every typed command.  That
seems like something the Illuminati of the world would make a high
priority.  If that doesn't exist, then I
bet plenty of celebs have entourage members who double as PORN STYLISTS.  They surf all the dirty sites all day long
for the bossman and pick the choicest new tidbits for him based on what they
know he likes (big butts, etc).  Then
they hand him an untraceable iPad with all the good links ready to go.  That's what I would have Fonsworth do for me.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, I bet you that Tom Brady sees himself as above fapping
to standard porn in his room, alone.  My bet
is that if he videotapes himself WITH his old lady.  Like, I bet they hire a professional stylist
and director of lighting and everything and then get it on REAL good.  Then he takes that DVD on road trips and uses
it for his own ends.  I bet that's what
happens.  He's a fucker.

know?You'd never know about it. 
The President would be dead from "sudden cardiac arrest" or some
other pat cause of death.  Because if
America learned about the suicide, everyone would want to know why and no one
would buy the first explanation.  After
all, your average President has too large of an ego to ever commit
suicide.  So it would have to be some
pretty extreme shit to cause him to put a gun to his mouth: a secret love child
with a blackmailing mistress, an illegal war, a sex tape with a dog, etc.  You would never find out about it until the
Vice President took over and you were already used to him being the guy in
charge.  THEN the sordid shit would start
to trickle out and you'd be like, "Oh wow, that makes sense.  Good thing we have ol' President Underwood in
charge now OMG WHAT IF HE WAS IN ON IT?"

<p>
 We wouldn't lose all stability just because the president
offed himself.  All of the entrenched,
pointless government institutions that the president was never able to rid
America of would still be around and would hum on as usual.  The CIA black ops squad doesn't need a
president around to tell them who to massacre and who not to massacre!  DON'T BE SO NAIVE.

<p>
 I still wear old t-shirts, including a free K-Swiss T-shirt
I got once that says MADE IN CALIPORNIA across the front, which seems highly
inappropriate.  And if I have a favorite
t-shirt that's fully pit-stained out, my old lady will toss those into the
"Gym only" pile as well, despite my opposition.  You and I should probably spring for actual,
somewhat adult gym clothing, but holy shit, I don't think there's a single item
in the Under Armour store that costs less than $50.  No man alive wants to pay $50 for a piece of
clothing that he will immediately defile with his fromunda cheese.  This is why you go to a gym and see fifty men
in old KAPPA SIG OLYMPICS: IF YOU AIN'T 'FACED, YOU IN LAST PLACE shirts and
50 women in $100 Lululemon pants. 
Women don't destroy gym clothing at the pace that men do, so they can
afford to spring for that crap.  We
cannot.  If I buy some nice adidas T-shirt
with my own money, that is NOT gym wear. 
That is home lounge wear.  Maybe
even going out wear.
</p>
<p>
 I think you're fine to wear old clothes at the gym for as
long as is financially necessary.  When
you've made your millions and paid for your house and the kids have gotten
through college and somehow you aren't a broke-ass piece of shit by the end of
that process, maybe you can start buying proper gym clothes.*

  In Minnesota, they have a School Safety Patrol Training
Center called Legionville up north of Brainerd. Basically, it's a week
long camp for elementary school kids who want to become crossing guards or
on the bus patrol (nerd alert). When you are 9 years old, the bus
patrol kids were fucking gods. I wanted in on that action and if this camp
would help me get there, I was all in.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was the summer of 92 and it would be my first time away
from home. I remember getting home sick right away that night. It was a
crippling. The next morning after breakfast, they had a kickball game for all
the campers. During this kickball game &ndash; it all went wrong. Big time. I had to
flee from the field mid-game and made a beeline to the bathroom but it was too
late. I had shit myself. Not a solid shit, but the wet, sloppy nervous shit
that a puppy has when you first switch to new dog food. I was terrified. I
somehow managed to not get shit on my zubaz shorts, but my hanes underwear was
a goner. I panicked and did the only thing I could think of &ndash; I stripped off my
shit stained underwear, plopped them in the toilet and tried to flush it all
away. It didn't work. In fact, it clogged up the entire system. The counselors
had to ask each bunkhouse who did it. They had to call a plumber out. I never
confessed to it. The cool kids at camp decided that it must have been the
smelly kid, Sam. They started making fun of Sam for shitting his pants and trying
to flush his underwear. I joined them in mocking him. The cool kids and I
became friends and spent the rest of the week playing basketball, kickball and
bullying Sam &ndash; the kid who supposedly shit his pants and tried to flush his own
underwear down the toilet.
