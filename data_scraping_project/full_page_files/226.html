  One of my friends thought it would be funny to subscribe me to a magazine called "Dairy Goat Monthly" and just let me tell you, it's the craziest fucking thing I have ever seen in my life. Just look at these pictures. [See first photo]

  When this came in the mail the other day, I could hardly contain my excitement. I was desperately in search of a way to build a hay manger, and I definitely needed help in worming my goats.

  The magazine is about 40 pages and every single one of them is filled with insane ramblings about goats. There's even recipes for what to cook for your goat, though I didn't check to see if any of them involved blanching grass.
