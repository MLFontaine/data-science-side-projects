 Before we get to the Funbag, a quick programming note: There will NOT be a Deadcast this week (we did one last week, even though there was no official post announcing it). Anyway, all four of you who listen to the Deadcast will have to wait until next week for it. The rest of you should carry on as usual with your 4th of July plans. God, these are the deadest two weeks of the year, every year. It&rsquo;s like the world died.
</p>
<p>
 Also, I&rsquo;m gonna do some lazy crowdsourcing this week for GREAT MOMENTS IN FIREWORKS FAILURE and WORST SCHOOL FIGHT HORROR STORIES. So if you&rsquo;ve ever had your arm blown off by an M80 or you&rsquo;ve ever lost a fight in school (or both!), get in touch with me at the email link above.

  So what happens if a competitor chokes on a hot dog and dies onstage during Nathan&rsquo;s hot dog eating contest? A time out to remove the body? Everyone keeps eating and just ignores it? Do they call the contest right there and award the win to the leader at the time of death? Or just cancel it forever?

<p>
 This actually happened a year ago at a hot dog eating contest in the appropriately named town of
 <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/man-dies-in-custer-hot-dog-eating-contest/article_2ea4cd5b-becc-5290-b4eb-3cf4c6e18386.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  Custer City, S.D.
 </a>
 A man named Walter Eagle Tail choked to death during the event. As a result, festival organizers canceled a pie-eating contest that was scheduled for the next day, no doubt foiling Lardass&rsquo; master plan to barf all over Bossman Bob Cormier. CHOW DOWN, WIDE LOAD.
</p>
<p>
 I scanned through all the press clippings from Eagle Tail&rsquo;s death but couldn&rsquo;t find anything that said whether or not the contest was allowed to keep going (my guess would be that the contest ended as he was choking, or it was stopped after everyone realized something was amiss).
</p>
<p>
 There is also no indication that the same contest will be held at Way Park this weekend.
 <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/man-dies-in-custer-hot-dog-eating-contest/article_2ea4cd5b-becc-5290-b4eb-3cf4c6e18386.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  The original article
 </a>
 says, &ldquo;Wheeler said he was not sure if the death will prompt organizers to make changes to the contest next year.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know what changes they could make, given that paramedics were already on hand for the contest. &ldquo;NEW RULE: PLEASE DON&rsquo;T CHOKE.&rdquo; Major League Eating, which is something that exists, took great pains to note that the Custer tragedy was not an officially sanctioned hot dog eating contest. It was a black market wiener jam!

 I contacted Nathan&rsquo;s to ask about the prospect of a contestant dying at this year&rsquo;s 4th of July contest. Here now is my full email exchange with their PR rep:

  <strong>
   ME:
  </strong>
  Oh, excellent. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. My question was: if someone chokes to death during the contest, is the contest discontinued by rule? Or is it a play-it-by-ear thing?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   NATHAN&rsquo;S:

  Safety has always been a priority for Major League Eating. Emergency Medical personnel will be present and at the ready on July 4th. In fact, EMTs are present at all MLE events both large and small. Thanks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ME:
  </strong>
  Okay, but what if someone dies anyway? Obviously you&rsquo;d do all you could to prevent something bad from happening, but are there contingency plans in case?

<p>
 My guess is that the contest would be stopped to attend to Joey Chestnut mid-choke and that the title would be vacated. All hot dogs consumed thereafter would be left half-eaten in memoriam. The contest would go on as scheduled the following year, with a moment of silent farting for the fallen. That&rsquo;s the classy move.

<p>
 They&rsquo;re getting worse.
 <em>
  Age of Ultron

 had TWO &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; end-credit scenes, and
 <em>
  Ant-Man
 </em>
 will also have a pair of them. Even
 <em>
  Entourage
 </em>
 had a bonus scene. I&rsquo;m not kidding: After the end credits, Ari&rsquo;s assistant gets married, and then the whole crew gets together and they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Boy, this would make a cool TV show!&rdquo; And,
 <em>
  fin
 </em>
 . Now you know. I think you&rsquo;re stronger for it.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, these bonus scenes are a scourge. They were clearly cooked up by union organizers at BIG GAFFER to ensure that Richie, the electrician, has his end credit viewed by a captive audience. Marvel also uses end-credit sequences to throw out a cameo appearance from their next E-list superhero (ZOMG! IT&rsquo;S GRASSMAN! he can control the grass!) so that fanboys shit their dicks (it takes nothing to get a fanboy excited) and save up $12 for the next shitty Marvel movie. They&rsquo;re ads. If you like them, you are a fucking sheep.
</p>
<p>
 Any material that&rsquo;s good enough to be in the movie should be in the movie. Otherwise, I would prefer to go the fuck home. One day, they&rsquo;re gonna make a movie that&rsquo;s just a series of 90 trailers, distributed in stages across various media platforms. Check out the 86

  Rank pretzel shapes for me. Mine is minis, twists, rods, then those little sticks. What shapes am I forgetting? But you can&rsquo;t deny the sticks are a hate crime&mdash;you can&rsquo;t pick up any amount of dip with them.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 My kids love those little sticks dipped in cream cheese, and I always break them when I attempt to drag them through a tub of Philly. The silver lining is that all broken pretzel sticks are for ME, so I get high on my supply. So much broken-pretzel goodness.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, here is my pretzel ranking:
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  1. Rod.
 </strong>
 So sturdy. So strong. Can withstand dipping and/or being smothered in dark chocolate and rainbow sprinkles.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  2. Big, soft pretzel knot
 </strong>
 . I took my kids on a road trip last week, and at a rest stop, the 9-year-old got a cinnamon pretzel at Auntie Anne&rsquo;s. This thing was covered in 90 pounds of cinnamon and dripping with grease. I&rsquo;m not even sure it qualifies as a pretzel. It&rsquo;s a Cinnabon in pretzel clothing. Anyway, it was good. I regret nothing.
</p>
<p>
 Also: in Germany, they serve HUGE soft pretzels in the beer gardens, and the Germans slather them with soft butter. They may be humorless supremacists, but they know their way around a pretzel.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  3. Small knot.
 </strong>
 Bite-sized. No mess. Aesthetically pleasing. The go-to snack of airport lounges the world over. Often covered in frosting disguised as &ldquo;yogurt.&rdquo; Sure it&rsquo;s yogurt, buddy. I bet those are super-healthy for you.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  4. Those little grid things.
 </strong>
 Like math, but you can eat it!
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  5. Nub.
 </strong>
 Bite-sized. No mess. Often dusted in powdered industrial flavoring.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  6. Pretzel pieces.
 </strong>
 Ditto.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  7. Thin knots
 </strong>
 . Whatever.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  8. Olde-timey hard sourdough knots.
 </strong>
 These fuckers shatter with just the slightest tooth pressure. One bite and I&rsquo;m holding a fistful of shards. It&rsquo;s bullshit. And they&rsquo;re hard as rocks! You need a rock crusher to break them down properly. I&rsquo;ve had enough of those fuckers.

  How does the best team in the CFL finish in major college football? For the sake of this argument, say the Calgary Stampeders (last year&rsquo;s champs, had to Google this) was placed in the SEC East for the 2015 season. I say they finish last because of the talent disparity (they start like 10 Canadians), but my buddy insists that their age and experience trumps the bottom of the SEC.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Last in the SEC East? Fuck no. No way. IT&rsquo;S MEN VERSUS BOYS, NICK. And that division is garbage (the West, by comparison, is murderous). I&rsquo;m not gonna fuck up this question like I did the
 <a href="http://t.co/W1L933oJ5p" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

 </a>
 thing from a couple weeks ago. The Stampeders
 <a href="http://www.stampeders.com/roster/index" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  roster
 </a>
 includes MANY players from D-I schools, including the legendary Drew Tate. They&rsquo;re not finishing last. Assuming it&rsquo;s 11-on-11 on a standard American football field, and there&rsquo;s time to prepare, the CFL team is winning that division, and they probably beat Nick Saban&rsquo;s Bad-Time Murder Factory in the conference title game (FACT: Blake Sims, the Tide&rsquo;s QB last season, was just cut from a CFL team). Just to be certain, I asked Canadian person Bruce Arthur if a CFL team would win the SEC. His reply: &ldquo;The best one? I say probably to definitely. CFL teams are basically a sort of college football B all-star team, and they&rsquo;re pros. But the rules make a big difference. CFL team would need some time to practice.&rdquo;

<p>
 Got it? They win that division. They ain&rsquo;t quaking in their boots at the prospect of toppling Missouri.

 Obviously, we would have to annex BC and make their football team part of the SEC. Seriously though, if British Columbia ever attempted to defect to the United States, I assume we would politely decline to accept them, even though we shouldn&rsquo;t.

We got all your good kush. And we&rsquo;re coming for Ontario next. Soon, you&rsquo;ll be reduced to nothing but a series of igloos. WE OWN YOU. Try to stop us.

 I&rsquo;m taking the 250k in 2015, especially if I live somewhere cheap like Kansas or whatever. You can live like a god on that much money provided you aren&rsquo;t stupid enough to live in New York or San Francisco. You can have a big house and a pool and a fancy sound system for your television. I know it would be tempting to travel back in time and be a rail baron in 1940 and throw lavish parties at your Hamptons estate. YOU ARE GATSBY. You&rsquo;d also get to make political power plays and crush your enemies with your largesse. But you&rsquo;d have no TV or web access. What would you do then? Read? Travel on steamships? Talk to people and grow as a person? That sounds awful. I&rsquo;m not giving up all the cushy accoutrements of 21st-century living just to be a wartime oligarch. They didn&rsquo;t even have comfy shoes back then.

<p>
 Since I didn&rsquo;t get laid on prom night (I went with a friend who already had a boyfriend; when I begged her for a hookup, she gave me a pity kiss on the lips), I say that roughly TWO percent of all prom dates end in proper consummation. That&rsquo;s it. If the percentage is any higher, I don&rsquo;t wanna know about it. I&rsquo;d prefer to think that everyone is either too drunk or too emotionally conflicted or too busy rescuing their best friend from &ldquo;Big Chad&rdquo; to get laid that night. All I got was a kiss, god dammit. If all you TEENS are out there fucking in the back of a limousine when I couldn&rsquo;t even cop a feel, you can all go to hell.

 You&rsquo;re right: She&rsquo;s lying her face off. She doesn&rsquo;t love him. She sounds like she just resigned from coaching the L.A. Clippers. She&rsquo;s just trying to take the high road and make him feel better so he doesn&rsquo;t come after her with a gun. She TOTALLY doesn&rsquo;t want him. She wants a restraining order. I rule in favor of the woman. This is not true of other songs. Take Richard Marx&rsquo;s &ldquo;Should&rsquo;ve Known Better.&rdquo; That girl was a total bitch.

Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if all former presidents and their spouses got to live at the White House for the rest of their lives? I bet there would be disagreements.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Former presidents aren&rsquo;t just allowed to come and go from the White House as they please. Once you&rsquo;re out of there, you&rsquo;re out there. If the new president tells his staff, &ldquo;Hey, let Barry crash any time he wants,&rdquo; they can probably make that happen. But if the new president is like, &ldquo;Man, fuck that Barry guy. If he shows up at the parking gate, piss on his windshield,&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll turn the old president away. That&rsquo;s how it works. I bet Nixon spent the majority of his retirement begging to be let back in.

 If I were president, I would adorn the grounds in black lights and pump out EDM from the speakers and have a bunch of surly bouncers standing right outside the gate, turning away all the ex-presidents and Eurotrash. Only weed dealers and sexy ladies would be allowed inside. AND YOU MUST WEAR WHITE TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

 HOWEVER, if they&rsquo;re paying to put you on a plane and in a hotel, and you got nothing better to do, why not? Hell, you could just fly to wherever and then skip the festival. It&rsquo;s not like Bud Light would care. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Kevin? Anyone seen Kevin? THIS PARTY CAN&rsquo;T START WITHOUT KEVIN.&rdquo; You could accept the invite, see if they send you to a cool town, and then either a) skip the plane ride if they&rsquo;re sending you to Akron, or b) spend a free night in a cool city like Chicago. You have nothing to lose, especially if you have no kids. If I had no kids, you could send me to a gravel quarry for a day and I&rsquo;d be all right with it. Look at all that gravel!

I&rsquo;m not talking simply gameplay mode, either. Do you think heads of NFL franchises play the franchise mode? Does Shad Khan play as the owner of the Jaguars and move them to London every time? Did Chip Kelly get the idea to trade LeSean McCoy from actually doing it first in Madden?

 NFL coaches don&rsquo;t play Madden because they don&rsquo;t have time. Or, at least, they would like to make it
 <em>

 that they don&rsquo;t have time because all they care about is WINNIN&rsquo; FOOTBAW GAMES. They can&rsquo;t be seen dicking around on Xbox when Belichick is reporting for duty at 3 a.m. after banging your mom. I also think coaches are snobs who look down on childish video games and prefer to focus on
 <em>
  real
 </em>
 football, which is as important to them as curing brain cancer.
</p>
<p>
 I think there might be a few young coaches (Mike Tomlin) or assistant coaches (any RB coach) who play Madden because they were former players themselves, and they still like to play and still like to connect with players in that way. But in general? Not a chance. These are VERY SERIOUS people who can&rsquo;t be seen doing something so trivial.

 Now, college coaches? Totally different thing. I bet Spurrier plays Madden DURING real football games.
