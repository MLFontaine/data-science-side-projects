 Before I get to
your letters, some quick housekeeping: I was scheduled to attend tonight's
National Press Club Book Fair and sign books and shit, but then my son got
pneumonia.  I was told it was mild
pneumonia, and not
 <em>
  Secret of Nimh
 </em>
 -level
pneumonia, but then I started coughing up chunks of lung sponge myself.  My old lady keeps trying to get my son to
cover his mouth when he coughs, but I know better.  I didn't start consistently covering my mouth
for coughs until age 27.  That kid ain't
covering SHIT.
</p>
<p>
 The worst part is
that I took my kid to a birthday party a week or so ago just as he was coming
down with this.  I didn't realize he was
sick until he was sitting at the birthday cake table and coughing in the face
of every child in plain sight.  I could
see bits of spittle fly from his mouth into the mouths of his friends.  It's horrifying when you know that you're responsible
for the future misery of 10 different households.  I should buy every guest a crock of soup.

 <p>
  A medical issue
last year has forced me to take a blood thinner (Coumadin) on a daily basis. I
will likely be taking them for the rest of my life. It blows. I'm not supposed
to drink, but I have one here and there. Not good enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  I've got this
overwhelming urge to drink shot after shot of a high quality bourbon&hellip; but it
ain't happening. I'm managing to control the impulses. I was never a problem
drinker, but GOD I LOVED drinking. Nothing like a handful of beers with the
guys to ease stress.
 </p>
 <p>
  But I need other
options.  What are suitable replacements
for alcohol in your life when you've still got the urge but can't partake? It's
too late to start smoking weed, right? I'm not Willie Nelson, for goodness
sake.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It's NEVER too late
to start smoking weed.  I didn't start
smoking weed until after college, which is all kinds of wrong.  It's the exact opposite of how you should do
things.  When I was in high school, I was
morally against weed for some reason.  I
have no clue why.  I was really
scandalized whenever I heard about people doing it and I looked down on the
burnouts toking up out in the woods.
</p>
<p>
 This was back in '90s, when kids who smoked weed were really into Phish and old Dick's Picks
bootlegs of Grateful Dead concerts, and I fucking hated ALL of that, which I
stand by.  Those people ruined weed for a
whole generation, I tell you.  I would
have been able to handle the crippling anxiety and self-loathing of teenage
virginity much better if I had gotten on board the hippie train, but that music
was dogshit.
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, one of the
saving graces of starting weed at an older age is that it's still new and
exciting and naughty when everything else in life&mdash;booze, sex, tobacco&mdash;is just
starting to become routine.  It's good to
stagger your introduction to new vices, so that you always have a new, awful
habit to look forward to.  I scheduled my
first weed buy when I was 25 or so and I felt like I was organizing a casino
heist.  SO MUCH DANGER.  I've never felt so alive.  YOU ARE NEVER TO OLD TO BREAK ALL THE ROOLZ.
</p>
<p>
 So by all means,
get started on being a useless, pot-smoking bag of shit.  It's always good to try new things: weed,
sweetbreads, becoming a licensed gun owner, and such and such.

 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I don't think anything
significant would happen because too much time has passed.  Even if you knew for certain that X country
was to blame for the killing, the principals involved would probably all be
dead, or near dead, or (in the case of Fidel Castro) dead but kept in a warm bath of Cuban infant cord blood until reanimation takes place.  I don't know how you can avenge Kennedy's
death when the world's balance of power and the players involved have changed
so radically since that time.  The only
thing that would happen is that
 <em>
  Vanity
Fair
 </em>
 would have a fresh excuse to run yet another cover with old photos of
the Kennedy family in between months where they run old photos of Grace Kelly on the cover.
</p>
<p>
 There comes a point
when history remains history, no matter what you discover after the fact.  After, say, a hundred years have passed, and
the world's population has turned over completely, people treat new discoveries
about history with an objective sense of curiosity instead of having a visceral
reaction to it.  For example, let's say
you're an archaeologist and you stumble upon some ancient burial ground and you
analyze the bones and you discover that 20,000 people were killed on this site
back in 569 AD.  You're not gonna be sad
if you discover this.  You're not gonna
even cry.  You're just gonna be like
THESE STAB HOLES ARE FASCINATING! 
EVERYONE COME SEE!
</p>
<p>
 That's not quite
the case with JFK, obviously.  There are
plenty of people who are still alive (my parents included) and who still
remember that day as arguably the saddest day in American history (for my
generation, 9/11 takes the honors).  I'm
sure they would have an angry, emotional response to the discovery that Lee
Harvey Oswald was a Russian double agent working in conjunction with the
reverse vampires.  But the anger would be
dispersed:
 <em>
  Why did this come out
now?  Did that Warren guy know all this
shit and not tell us?  And why weren't we
informed that JFK had a hooker blowing him in the footwell during the
procession?
 </em>
 You wouldn't be able to
do much about it.

  With the union nixing a longer schedule,
and having all four big networks paying astronomical dollars to broadcast
football and ticket prices about as high as they can before they are starting
to depress attendance (even further than it already is), and literally everyone
and their mom buying NFL gear, have we reached Peak NFL?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I think we've
passed Peak NFL.  Youth football
participation is already way down thanks to concussion awareness, which means
the talent pool will get thinner.  That
will coincide with the Ginger Hammer expanding the league to London and LA and penalizing
defenders for leading with their head, neck, shoulders, chest, hands, or diaphragm.  All of that will make the product shittier
and eventually decrease its market value.
</p>
<p>
 Even though last
night's game was damn near a work of art, this hasn't been a great NFL
season.  Everyone is hurt.  Apart from maybe Seattle, every team is
flawed in some obvious way.  The teams
with shitty QBs (and there are many) have REALLLLLY shitty QBs.  It is not an ELITE season.  So whether you think Peak NFL was back when
you could openly choke offensive players LIKE A MAN, or back in the Bill Walsh
Era, or (like me) during the remarkable stretch of great Super Bowls from 1997
to last January, I don't think the future bodes all that well.  But I'll still watch.  I got fantasy money to lose.

<p>
 No.  As much as I hate the idea of INTANGIBLES and
all that nonsense, there's still a human element to the job.  It's not simply a matter of having the best
strategy&mdash;it's
 <em>
  convincing
 </em>
 all the
players that you have the best strategy and that they should be confident that
you know what you're doing.  A robot
doesn't have that ability because robots are assholes.  You think Steve Smith is gonna take orders
from a robot?  BITCH YOU AIN'T EVER

into a million pieces.
</p>
<p>
 You can't have the robot
be the head coach. HOWEVAH, you could have a human head coach and just hire
the robot as a shadow assistant.  None of
the players or token assistants ever need to know that the head coach is
getting all of his ideas from the BlitzTron 9000.  You just keep that robot locked in a dungeon
so that no one is ever the wiser.

Ben comes off the field after a 3-and-out, sulking and glaring daggers at Todd

but with the regrettable lack of Bud Light Lime in the Gatorade coolers.

 You could start an

Roethlisberger.  I'm not sure there's
another active sports figure who has personally pissed off more people than Big
Ben (and I mean in terms of face-to-face interaction&mdash;I'm not talking about
some athlete that pissed you off because he had a bad fantasy day).  The list is like Big Ben, Tiger Woods, A.J. Pierzynski, and Floyd Mayweather.  I'm talking about guys who are dicks to

  I'm a casual smoker and I bought myself a
zippo lighter. It makes a noise when you open and close it, but mostly I like
it because, unlike a Bic, it stays lit once you fire it up. Secretly, I imagine that I will need it when a bunch
of guys are trying to kill me. They're all in a building that I have secretly
wired with explosives. There is a trail of gasoline leading to the explosives,
and I fire up the zippo, casually toss it on the gasoline, and then ride away
in my motorcycle while shit blows up behind me. That's what a zippo is for.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Goddamn right it
is.  Half the time, I think smokers like
to smoke just because you get to play with fire 20 or 30 times a
day.  It never gets old.  Even when you put the lighter away, you still
get to hold a burning object in your hand for a minute or two, and that's no
small thrill in an otherwise boring existence.
</p>
<p>
 Any time someone
has a Zippo at a bar, I ask to play with it for three minutes.  Then I try to do that thing where you flick
your wrist and it opens by itself, like they do it in old movies and videos.  I cannot do it.  I suck at lighters.  I can't even get a Bic to work.  In order for me to properly work a lighter, I
need to be inside a ventless room with no air circulation of any kind.  Otherwise, I'm doomed.  Fucking wind.

<p>
 It's because the
cartons and chopsticks give the actors something to do with their hands while
they talk.  They can hold up a takeout
carton and fiddle around and LOOK like they're eating even though they didn't
take a bite of anything.  Any time I see
those cartons in a movie, I want Chinese food more than anything else in the
world.
</p>
<p>
 I worked on a shoot
once and found out that a lot of TV shows and movies have a cheat where the
actor puts a piece of food or a utensil down right at the beginning of a scene,
so that the viewer thinks they just took a bite of something, even though they
didn't.  It's a cheat.  I felt so used when I found out.  I want to believe that the
 <em>
  Ghostbusters

 really did eat all of the petty-cash Chinese food before that first call came
in.

  Why doesn't the NFL just flip the value of a safety and field
goal with kickers getting better and better? The loss of that 3rd point should
be enough to decrease the amount of kicks, and
honestly I think this better matches the difficulty of each scoring play to
begin with.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I'm fine with
that.  The reason a safety is only two
points is because it's also a turnover, so you can potentially swing the game
by nine points so long as your GLORY BOY offense gets a TD after the free
kick.  But I'm OK with making it a
three- or even a four-point score, because safeties are so rare.  That's why defenders get so excited when they
think they've gotten one.  They jump
around and make the "A" with their hands like they just won a million bucks
because 1) they never get them, and 2) defenders hate that offensive players
usually get to do all the scoring, and get real excited when they get points of
their own.  Everyone loves to score, no
matter what the sport is.  Not scoring
sucks.
