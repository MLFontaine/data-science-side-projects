 I pride myself on not being the squeamish type, but I want nothing to do with whatever comes out of a woman's body during the ENEMY WITHIN days. It's just&hellip; unnecessary. I can't speak for all of mankind on this, but I've yet to encounter a guy who says to his lady, "Wait! Don't throw out that tampon. Let's bust out the microscope and see what you got going on."
</p>
<p>
 Now, I realize this is somewhat hypocritical. I'm completely hypocritical when it comes to male and female body functions. Like, I could spend all day ripping farts at home and laugh my ass off while my wife is covering her nose. But if SHE lets out a whopper? I act completely offended and grossed out. HOW COULD YOU DO THAT? YOU'RE A GIRL AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SMELL LIKE ROSE WATER AND COTTON CANDY. Complete double standard. It's like boogers. I find my own boogers fascinating. But if someone tried to wipe one of their boogers on me, I might throw up. That's just how it is. Our own bodily quirks are interesting because they're our own.

  Here's one for you: the armored truck fantasy. I'm so paranoid when I'm near one (especially if we're in a parking lot) I'll start assuming maybe these guys are on high alert and they might suspect me of trying to jack them. Do they think I will crash my car into the truck or the guy walking from the store? Could I really make a break for it and somehow take out the money collector as he's about to enter the truck, grab the loot and make a get away?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I have to think all armored car drivers are aware, at all times, that anyone who sees their truck will immediately, reflexively, envision jacking it. I know that's what I'm thinking. Ram the fucker with my car, back door flies open, BOOM! Giant sacks of money with dollar signs emblazoned on the front there for the taking. They shouldn't even use armored cars anymore. They should just use a shabby-looking Mayflower truck that's outfitted inside with state-of-the-art security equipment. Maybe that's what they already do. Maybe every armored car you see out there is just a very clever decoy set up by the Brinks corporation. COCKTEASES.

  Is there anything worse than the first time you use a new stick of deodorant? It's like putting a sharp block of wood in your armpit and moving it around. Granted, I use the white solid stick, not the gel stuff. But anyhow, not only is the top of the stick sharp around the edge, you get tons and tons of flakes and excess crust that falls off, thus ruining your shirt. I should just mold the thing over the trash can first and then put it under my arm, but who am I kidding, I'm too lazy to do that.

 I press the stick against my palm to get rid of the ridges around the rim, then I wipe my hand on my armpit just for the sordid thrill of it.

 There are deodorants you can buy that aren't so horrible on the first swipe. Old Spice will fuck you on your initial use, but some deodorants come pre-rounded, and they are a delight. Like the reader who savored breaking the surface of a new peanut butter jar, there's an immense satisfaction to be had from taking off that little plastic shield on the new stick, marveling at the smooth top, and then jamming that shit right in your bagpipes. So, so wrong.
</p>
<p>
 I remember when clear deodorants were all the rage and I first got one and you dialed it up, and the gel would squiggle out of the little grate at the top. Those sticks did NOTHING. If anything, they were perspirants. But dialing up that little Play Doh fun factory each morning was tremendous.

  Whenever I'm in a busy public space and I see someone I know in the distance I play this game of pretend where I don't know said person is approaching. I do the check of the cell phone. Then you get maybe 20 yards away from the person and can't ignore them any longer but saying anything to them just gets drowned out and you awkwardly both say what. Then you finally stop and talk to each other causing a major traffic jam of pedestrians. Stop and chats should be illegal.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I also prolong dealing with the acquaintance as long as humanly possible, which I think is perfectly normal. If you saw them 20 yards away, screamed out their name, and ran to them like it was The Sound Of Music, that would be fucked up. There's a time and place for lengthy conversations, and anyone with a brain knows the middle of the grocery store, with your kids tugging at you, isn't fucking it. This happens in front of me all the time at the store, and I always want to break the chatters up by ramming them with my cart.
</p>
<p>
 I try and wrap up stop and chats and surprise phone chats in a very quick manner. I just say, "Okay, well say hi to (whoever) for me. I AM NOW SIGNALING T YOU THAT I AM READY TO END THIS SHIT." Most people take that lead and wrap it up.

 <p>
  I was about to cross the busy street I live on to get to the train, which is in the very wide median. There's a crosswalk spanning the two lanes, with blinking lights activated by two bollards that you pass through. I stepped into the crosswalk, and I see a city van, a parking ticket-writer van, barreling toward me in the left lane. The van slams on its brakes, starts to fishtail, and then swerves into the right lane where there were no cars, blows through the crosswalk and keeps going as if nothing had happened.
 </p>
 <p>
  It missed me by no more than 2 feet and was going 35-40 mph, close enough that I felt the breeze from it. The thing that messed with me afterward is that I did nothing. I DID NOT MOVE. If that van hadn't corrected after the swerve, or if it had skidded sideways, I would have been pinned against a building by two overweight, chain-smoking piece of shit ticket writers. I've been thinking about this for days and have really beaten myself up for not jumping out of the way in heroic/acrobatic fashion.
 </p>

<p>
 Don't worry about that detail of the story. What's important here is that YOU ALMOST DIED, and you must breathlessly tell anyone you find how close you were to the Great Unknowable, and let them know this has shaken you to your core.
</p>
<p>
 When I lived in New York, I stumbled out of a bar shitfaced one night at 2 or 3AM. I was walking down Park Ave. South when, from out of nowhere, a taxi careened off the road and crashed into a street lamp. If the street lamp hadn't been there to block the taxi, the taxi would have run me over. AND I WOULD HAVE DIED. And you can bet your ass I told everyone at the office the next day about my harrowing experience. YOU FOLKS ARE LUCKY TO SE ME TODAY. I WAS NEARLY ROADKILL. Oh, sure, I was shitfaced and in no shape to get out of the way, but that's beside the point. So don't bother with the part where you stand there like a retarded deer while this is unfolding all around you. Get the amount of concern that will make you feel loved and wanted.
</p>
<p>
 Another near-death story: When I was three or something, I came across a pool in the winter that was uncovered. There were floating chunks of ice in the pool. Naturally, being three, I assumed if I jumped onto the ice, I could stand on the ice and surf around the pool. So I jumped. The ice immediately tipped and I slipped down into the water. My brother, who was with me, jumped and dragged me out.
</p>
<p>
 To this DAY, I still bring it up on occasion. "Hey guys, remember when (my brother's name) saved me in the frozen pool? I COULD HAVE DIED. YOU SAVED MY LIFE! I AM HARRY BAILEY, MIRACLE CHILD."
</p>
<p>
 All that said, I do occasionally get afraid some car or bus will go flying off the road and bash right into me. Ever have a bus coming down the street really fast? It always feels like it's about to jump the curb and take you right the fuck out. Unnerving. I remember when that dude from the Lions was killed in his own yard when a car jumped the curb and hit his ass. He was just in his yard, mowing his lawn, and BOOM! That completely freaks me the fuck out.

 There are few greater thrills than bringing down the house in the middle of a 6th to 8th grade class.

I felt like I had just won the fucking World Series. Everyone in class laughed, even the girls. I thought to myself, "THIS is the moment.

<p>
 This does not happen to me, because the Mrs. and I are both back sleepers. I have a solution for you, though. One of the first things a doctor tells you when you have a shit back is to NEVER sleep on your stomach. Ever. Totally fucks up your shit. So tell that fine lass of yours that, if she treasures her posture, she needs to sleep on her back or side. IT'S FOR HER BENEFIT! And why does she care what the bed looks like when you're in it? You're fucking asleep. Town And Country aren't going to show up to photograph you.

 I've said this before, but hotels are the fucking worst for toe confinement.

 I only do this when I buy the Mega Millions tickets. If the jackpot goes over $100 million, I always buy one ticket. Then I spend the next 20 hours thinking about all the things I'll buy. AND I make a point to give a little bit of the money to AIDS babies, because that makes me a good person if I give money to AIDS babies. I also have instructed my wife to tell NO ONE in the event that we win. Don't want any hangers on showing up and asking me for dough. So pathetic of them to look for a fucking handout.
</p>
<p>
 I have a list of people who are okay to tell, and a list of people to whom I'd be willing to give our money to: mostly family, but IMMEDIATE FAMILY ONLY. I don't want cousin Bob knowing about this shit. He's not getting a fucking penny.

 I also always do the tax calculations. "Okay, so we'll definitely take the lump sum payout, minus the taxes&hellip; We'll only have $42 million left! That's barely anything! We need to be judicious with this money!"

 I have been known to buy Powerball tickets and deliberately misplace them around the house, so that I will forget about them. My theory: Everyone who has won the lottery has done so forgetting they even bought the ticket. It's always the first thing you hear in the interviews. So I make it a point to forget that I have bought the ticket. Increases my odds exponentially, I tell you. THIS IS MATH.

 Hundreds of miles? Really?

 "Do you drink until you black out?" is one of the questions they ask you to gauge if you need to go to AA. So cut down to get rid of that internal guilt. That always ruins drinking. I'm of the mind that blacking out is acceptable on special occasions. Cousin's wedding? BLACKOUT. Bachelor party? BLACKOUT. Tuesday? BLACKOUT. All acceptable.

  Ever notice the completely random nature of music at the gym? For my freshman year of college, I would always deal with it because I didn't get an iPod until sophomore year, then I recently lost my iPod and it was about three days or so before I got a new one. During the times that I went to the gym without an iPod, they'd usually play one god awful dance or R&amp;B song after another, and then completely out of the blue comes "Your Love is Driving Me Crazy" by Sammy Hagar, or "Armageddon It" by Def Leppard. Then another hour of dance or R&amp;B.

 It's a real problem. My gym plays the same song by Squeeze every hour. Sometimes they play Spoon. Sometimes they play "House of Stone and Light". It makes no sense. And it's not an actual radio station. It's some cable or satellite station they have tuned in, like a JACK FM channel that went rogue.
</p>
<p>
 The worst part, by far, are the emo cover songs. My gym plays the Ataris' version of "Boys of Summer" all the time, intermingled with some other dipshit emo band covering "Time After Time". This always happens while I'm in the locker room, so I have to hurry to get my headphones on and turn on the Black Keys to drown it out. But by then, it's too fucking late. I've heard enough of the song for it to get stuck in my head at a later date. It's horrendous. I hate you, gym music supervisor. I hope you pull a DJ AM.
</p>
<p>
 They also play this song&hellip;
</p>
<p>
 I know it's a song for kids, but holy shit that is the worst fucking song I've ever heard.

  Why in the hell do I have to walk over to the fridge every 20-30 minutes and open the doors just to check the status of things?? I have already looked 100 times and I know what is in there. Of course, there is the extremely rare occurrence when someone slips something into the fridge without my knowledge, which is pure elation. Last night, I had a friend over and didn't pay a lot of attention when my wife came in, therefore I did not notice she had brought home her Chinese leftovers from lunch. When I discovered this unexpected treasure in the fridge I mowed through that shit like a fat kid in a doughnut shop.

 I check the fridge and cabinets all the time, just to see if I missed anything. Because I do miss things. My wife will be like, "Can you get me a lemon?" And I'll look, but I won't see it. So I tell her, then she checks, and it's sitting right fucking there.
</p>
<p>
 So checking the fridge repeatedly, for me, is a demonstration in the faith I have in my own obliviousness. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Maybe there's a whole smoked turkey in there I missed. Maybe I can make it appear in there WITH MY MIND POWERS. Usually though, I do it because I'm bored. I also check the fridge to see if there's something I can cook. And usually, we're just one ingredient shy of something awesome. I could make oatmeal raisin cookies right now, IF WE FUCKING HAD EGGS! GAHHHHHHH!!!!

  I watch a bukkake porn the other day. The guy that was next in line was awful close to the action and appeared to get hit with friendly fire from the guy in the front of the line. If that were you would you tough it out and stand there for another 45 seconds to a minute knowing full well some other guy just shot his load on you or would you lose your place in line to get a towel and wipe it off?

 Well look, you can't participate in a bukkake video without expected SOME skeet ordnance getting to you.

  What is your favorite "before they were commonly known as this one guy" cameo from a film or TV show? Mine is the one in "True Romance" when you got to watch Patricia Arquette be savagely beaten and brutalized by a pre-Tony Soprano James Gandolfini. Hands down.

 Don't forget Samuel L. Jackson in that SAME movie. "I eat the pussy, I eat the butt." That's a fucking blast. AND BRAD PITT AS FLOYD! The cast of that flick just grows in legend by the year. It's the most astonishing job by a casting director ever. Kudos to you, Billy Hopkins and Risa Garcia. Kudos.

 Other than that, Chris Rock in "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka". ONE RIB.

 I'm also partial to Alec Baldwin, pre-"Red October," playing scumbags in "Working Girl" and "Married to the Mob". Save me some soap, baby. Because I'm feeling EXTRA dirty tonight.

  Let's assume sexbots become common and affordable parts of our culture: Is it possible in any scenario to convince your average long term gf/wife to have a threesome with you and the sexbot?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 No. Unless your wife is in a coma and you are designated her mouthpiece or something. But that would kind of ruin it.

  Of course the best part of the film was finally seeing Nicole Eggert naked after years of watching her on "Charles in Charge." Isn't a nude scene with someone you never imagined you would see in a nude scene ten times better than when a chick gets naked in every movie?
 </p>

<p>
 I actually dated a girl once who claimed to be childhood friends with Eggert. I kept hoping there would come a day when she would introduce me to Eggert, we'd hit it off, and then I could engineer a diabolical switch over to having Eggert as my girlfriend. That, uh, never happened.
</p>
<p>
 I also found Katie Holmes' nudity in "The Gift" completely thrilling. AND SHE TALKS DIRTY. I never would have thought she'd do that. That made my glands happy. There should be a term for an actress' first career nude scene. "Breaking the Shymen," or something like that. In the case of Eggert, it was awesome. Speaking of which&hellip; BAM!
