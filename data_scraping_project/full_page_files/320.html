  Today, we're fucking it and doing it live.

</p>
<p>
 Two and a half years ago, I was laid off from my day job in advertising. And since I had to find a way to make enough money to support my family (blogging didn't quite make up the difference), I knew I had to do something productive with all of the newfound free time I had. Something big. I don't know if this is true of every dad, but when I had my first kid, some kind of Ambition Gene got triggered in my brain. I saw the new baby and my first thought, apart from "Does its head stay that shape?", was OH SWEET JESUS FUCK I GOTTA MAKE SOME MONEY. A lot of money. So much money that I didn't even bother putting a specific dollar amount on it, because kids require a lifetime of earnings so mountainous that to try and comprehend it will cause you to have a nervous breakdown. I knew I had to do something really ambitious, and I had to bust my nuts doing it.
</p>
<p>
 So I started writing
 <em>
  The Postmortal
 </em>
 , which comes out today (you can buy it through
 <a href="http://bigdaddydrew.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  here.
 </a>
 I wrote it in the summer of 2009 and spent the next two years rewriting it and editing it until it was fit for your consumption. People so far

  really like it,
 </a>
 (NOTE: Many of the reviews contain spoilers) but you'll get to be the final judge of whether or not I succeeded. All I can tell you is that I put everything I had into it. I left everything on the field. I'm really lucky to be able to crack stupid poop jokes with you folks here every week, and the truth is that this novel never would have been published without you. Eighteen editors passed on the book before it was rescued by a lone editor who also happened to be a Funbag reader. So it's with a whole lot of gratitude that I bring to you today's LIVEASS FUNBAG.

  Is there anything more amazing about the human body than it's ability to separate poop from fart and send an unspoken message to the brain that the pressure in your bowels is one or the other. Seriously, think of all the times you cut one loose with the volume and tone of a tuba with no concern for a rogue turd getting loose.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It's true. You feel pressure in your rectum and you know instinctively whether it's a real shit or just gas to pass. And sometimes, if you're really good, you can be somewhere where you have to shit, but you can't do it for whatever reason, and then FART to relive the pressure on your bowels without any poop coming out. I swear this can be done, and it's a wonder of human engineering. You talk about Intelligent Design!

  What is the most satisfying part of your body to scratch when it itches?

Or it's your scratching your balls. One, because there is no dignified way to do it and two, it just is so god damn relieving.

Now if someone hired me for an office job I'd be checking Tumblr within ten minutes of sitting down. It's probably why our economy is dying.

  When is it acceptable to turn off the air conditioning? I'm not even talking about in your home - I live in the northeast and don't even have a/c at home, but here at work it's off already, before we're even in September! This is surely wrong. I always used the rule of thumb that you had to wait until the temperature outside was lower than the a/c - so 70 here at work (no way are they springing to make us actually comfortable at 68). I also feel like a douche for complaining but if you want me to sit in this faux leather chair all day you could at least spring for air.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It is NEVER acceptable to turn off the air con. Even if it's 60 degrees outside, you can still be in a place that's 75 degrees indoors. And once that happens, the pit sweat comes out and everything goes to shit. My wife turned off the air con TODAY, during this chat. I swear I'm ten minutes away from dying of heat stroke, and it's probably 73 in here. I can't stand it. I am a horrible person.

 I took my kid to school for the first time yesterday and the school was jam packed with kids. they lined them up outside the classroom and waited for the bell to ring, and the hallway got unbearably hot. So hot that I started to get pangs of guilt. Like, this was a special day, but in the back of my mind, I just wanted the fucking class to open so I could go outside and stop breathing child fumes. Schools are hotter than death. Never teach in one.

 You'd never jerk off lying down again. It would always be a toilet jerk. If you're me, that doesn't change your life much. For me, jerking off while lying down is an insane luxury. I may as well feed myself caviar while doing it, it's so hard to pull off in a crowded house.

 And if you think it would suck for YOU, think about how a woman would feel being stuffed with a goddamn quart of fluid every time you skeeted. She'd never have sex again after feeling all that shit slide out the first time. It would be horrible. They'd have to invent some kind of vaginal sealant.

<p>
 They do! They get mom strength. Mom strength is no bullshit. Moms can carry a baby, three shopping bags, and a purse all with one arm. And they can discipline two more children with another arm. It's like they become octopi. They can keep children and objects within a manageable radius of their person at all times. It's incredible. It's liek physical strength AND telekenesis. I saw a mom walking to the bus stop yesterday with four kids, and all four kids stayed within smacking distance of her because she had that Mom ESP. Those kids were trapped in her mental forcefield. It was a marvel to behold.

I don't see much changing in the next four years. You watch the first movie and he goes back in time and is a badass on a skateboard, mindfucks his dad to asking his mom out wearing a nuke suit, and shreds on guitar like no one ever heard before. All we really got is the internet and better graphics on our video games. If we went back in time I can't think of anything we could do on Marty's level that shows off our future ass kicking skills. Does this annoy you too?

<p>
 It does, now that you mention it. In fact, kids back in 1985 were probably less sentient than people today, which means they'd be more active and probably fitter and happier. All I'd do if I went back to 1985 would be bitch about no WiFi access and ask where I could find a decent Peruvian chicken joint, only to be met with blank stares. It would be awful until I started gambling and amassing a goddamn fortune like Rob Corddry did in

  I was at the urinal at the gym when a little indian guy came up beside me wearing mesh shorts. He proceeds to the next urinal, but instead of pulling it over his shorts, he reaches down, pulls up the leg of the shorts, and pees out the bottom. This was just too weird. I would almost prefer the old days at amusement parks when the weirdos would drop trow all the way to the ankles for no apparent reason. That was less weird than this, no?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Um... Uh... Okay, I'll confess. I've pulled that move at the gym, especially if I'm wearing shorts that are really baggy. I have no clue why I do it. I think it's because I'm in a hurry and, in my mind, it's easier to not take my dick out over my waistband. I also think it might prevent drippage, but I know that's probably untrue.
</p>
<p>
 By the way, I dribble in my gym shorts after peeing all the time, and there's no grace period with some gym shorts when you've dribbled in them. That pee stain shows up right away. So if you're ever at my gym and you see me walking around with a copy of "Entertainment Weekly" over my dick, it's because I kinda peed myself. DON'T JUDGE.

 I'd like to say die at 50, because that would be the obvious and manly choice, but that's a lie. I don't want to die 16 years from now. That would be horrible. I'd just have to adjust. That's what life is about, really. Shit happens and you adjust. You have a kid and you adjust. People you love die and you adjust. Life is constantly tossing all this shit at you and you just have to deal with it best you can. So I could live without meat and weed and QOTSA, but I'd find a way to survive. You find new outlets.

If I ran any sort of company, I would be first in line to offer him a new kind of endorsement deal: every time he gets fined, we pay him the exact amount of the fine times two (or three or whatever). This way, not only is the fine negated, he EARNS money for laying vicious hits on "defenseless" WRs. It would be the greatest value in advertising history: for the only $250K (if you double the fine amount), you would get unparalleled exposure.

You have no responsibility and can hold on to that memory for the rest of your life. Is it teenage/college? You can talk shit to everyone and drink your face off. Is it middle age? You can enjoy the moment with your kids and family. Or is it old age when you can do whatever the fuck you want and people will give you a pass.

 I think it's college or your early 20's, because you have the free time AND the drinking stamina for it. Winning a championship at my age would be bullshit, because you'd still have to look after your kids for the next week instead of getting high and streaking across the state, which is what I'd really like to do. I saw the Twins win World titles in 1987 and 1991, and the both of those titles were just before I really became a full-fledged drinker and barnacle on society. I wish I could have moved those titles up by five years each. The Vikings almost made the Super Bowl when I was 23, and to paraphrase Bob Mould, I could have fucked a Coke machine if they had won at that age.

  Have you ever met Bill Simmons in person?

<p>
 No. Craggs met him once. AJ went out drinking with him once. I used to email with him a couple times until the ESPN horndoggery stuff that AJ posted. After that, Simmons never emailed AJ or I again. Here's one email exchange we had, about Tyree's catch in the Super Bowl, a play he always bitched about as "lucky".
</p>
<p>
 ME: For the record, Jeffrey Maier stealing the ball and gifting the Yankees a home run? That's a fluky play. A random wideout summoning the strength he never knew he had to trap a ball against his head and keep it there despite getting jacked? That would be the opposite of fluky.
</p>
<p>
 SIMMONS: What would you call it then? The guy had 4 catches that year and none since. He was a special teamer. It was like DJ Mbenga making a 25 footer while getting knocked into the scorer's table to save Game 7 of the Finals. We deserved to lose and they were better that day. But that catch still kills me. That entire play could be a 1-hour documentary. I always wanted to know why Tyree was 30 yards downfield on 3rd and 5.
</p>
<p>
 ME: Because when Eli is your QB, it's ALWAYS sound policy to go 25 yards beyond the spot where he's trying to throw the ball.
</p>

  I have met Simmons twice. We emailed quite often even after ESPN horndoggery. We stopped emailing after the whole Grantland/Craggs fiasco. I don't think he has any use for me anymore at this point. This is A.J., by the way.

 I wish I was immune to weatherman hype, but I failed to resist during Irene. I sat there in bed on Saturday night and I heard the wind blow and every time the gusts picked up I was like THIS IS IT. WE'RE BEING TAKEN TO OZ. Then I'd get up and take a piss and look out the window and see all the trees shaking, jostled around like big florets of broccoli. And I was just standing there, waiting for all of them to snap and crush the house and pin my kids against their beds, and then I'd have to saw them out and give them CPR and all of this horrible shit. I didn't sleep a wink all night. Then I woke up in the morning and five leaves were on the ground. And if no one had told me this was a hurricane, I would have slept like a baby. Trees rustle like that all the goddamn time. Instead I gave in and nearly had a panic attack. Fucking weathermen.

 The book was originally titled "The Cure For Death" before my agent asked me to change it, so I changed it to "The End Specialist" (which makes sense if you read the book but sounds like a book about a butt doctor without any context, which is actually fine by me since I find butts funny). That's how it was submitted to publishers. The US publisher didn't like the title and asked me to change it again, so I did. But the UK publisher (not the same publisher) wanted to keep it, so they did. And there you have it. I got paid either way, so they could have named the book FLUNKY AND THE ASSCHUGGERS and I'd have been fine with it.

But then I started thinking that $100,000 isn't enough for me to stand up and quit my job in that manner, in fact I would probably keep my job and buy something awesome with the 100 grand I just won. My question for you is what is the bear minimum amount you could win in a sweepstakes that would allow you to stand up and punch your boss in the face? I think mine would be a million dollars.

 Mine would be more, because if the Kid Factor. Each kid alone is probably a drain of about a million bucks when you factor in college and all that. It's a completely unreasonable number. So mine would be $10 million. $10 million would be enough for me to burn bridges and rub my balls on Daulerio's forehead. I watch "Chopped" a lot, and I always think it's bullshit that the prize is a measly $10,000. They can give out more than that.

  What is the etiquette in terms of conversation you like to have with a stripper (who you are getting a lap dance from)? I always wonder if I should just hold a normal conversation with them ("So how about that weather these last few days?") while their breasts are in my face, or if I should just ogle them creepily while they do what I'm paying them for, or if I should just tell them how much I love them. I'm sure they've had variations of all of the above, I just often wonder what they prefer?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I have no idea what they prefer. When I used to go to titty bars, I usually did my best to not say anything during the lap dance, which was actually all I could do because I was often rendered speechless by the writhing body in front of me. I get very quiet around any naked woman, because I'm so terrified of saying something retarded and fucking the whole thing up. But you'd be surprised how often strippers will actually initiate the conversation, I think out of boredom, or because they know "establishing a rapport" can help land them extra money and dances. I had stripper hiss in my ear once. Like, literally hissing like a snake. I had no idea how to respond. This was in Waterbury, CT. Don't go to a strip club in Waterbury, CT.

 I've also hit a hole-in-one (I have no proof, you'll just have to believe me), though those two events did not happen at once. So I feel like I'm somewhat qualified to answer this, and the answer is taking the hole-in-one and diarrheaing all over myself. Hitting a hole-in-one is a blast. I jumped up and down and screamed for at least five minutes. You would have thought I won the goddamn lottery. I told everyone I saw that day. It would be well worth shitting my pants on the course, because shitting my pants on the course was actually kind of fun, too.

I was also secretly dismayed (and this makes me a horrible person) that it wasn't a bigger NBA star accused of murder. I mean, we only get a sports-related murder every so often. And it always seems to be a marginal player like Crittenton or Rae Carruth. I'd like someone with a little bit higher Q rating, especially with the NBA locked out until 2018.

 I'll take Option 2, as much as it would SUCK. I already have serious back problems and I haven't even gotten to old age yet, so my existence as a senior citizen will be long and agonizing.

I'd spend all day thinking about what it would be like to get shot. Because I really do think that, in the microsecond between the bullet hitting you and you dying, it REALLY hurts. Like, a lot. And I'd prefer to not experience that.

 Plus, if I live long enough, maybe computers will find a way to solve my back pain and invent a type of heroin that has no side effects and then I'd feel like a zillion bucks. Imagine taking that bullet deal now, only to find out once you're 90 that you didn't need to take it. You'd be LIVID. I couldn't deal with that. It would be like leaving the grocery store and realizing they charged me for two items, only it's too late to go back and get a refund. I'd be so, so mad.
