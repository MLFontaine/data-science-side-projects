 My wife went to pick up my kid from school yesterday. Beforehand, she told me they were going to stay a little extra long to hang out at the playground. I, of course, didn't hear any of that because I was too busy playing in front of 150,000 at Castle Donington in my brain. MASTER! MASTER! MASTER OF PUPPETS IS PULLING YOUR STRINGS!!!
</p>
<p>
 Anyway, she goes off to get the kid, I expect her back at 12:30, and she's not back until much later. Because I didn't hear her say, "Hey, we're staying late," I call her phone multiple times to find out where she is. No one picks up.
</p>
<p>
 I have now reached the age where, if someone in my family doesn't answer the phone or is mysteriously late (or late to me, at least), I immediately assume they've perished in some sort of fiery banana truck accident out on the highway. It only takes about five minutes for me to silently panic and play out the next 20 years of my life as a grieving widower. "Oh, God. I'm gonna have to get married again. And there's no way she'll be as cool as my current wife. And she'll want MORE kids. And then they'll have to coexist with my son in an uneasy half-sibling relationship. Then she'll force me to move to Tampa. Then I'll end up growing a ponytail and working for a catamaran tours outfit. OH DEAR GOD NO PLEASE I WANT TO DIVORCE THIS HORRIBLE WOMAN RIGHT NOW."
</p>
<p>
 And then my wife called and all was right with the world again. I swear to God, if one of us perishes in a banana truck accident, it better be ME. Your letters:

<p>
 Not really. Listen, not a day goes by where I don't think about walking out my door and suddenly seeing a flash on the horizon, followed by a huge, billowing mushroom cloud. ZOMG! IT IS OFFICIALLY ON!
</p>
<p>
 I remember after 9/11, and they held these Congressional panels where some prick like Rumsfeld or someone like that was like, "There WILL be a nuke detonated here at some point." Well, FUCK MAN! What the fuck do I do now? WHAT AM I PAYING YOU FOR? Now, I totally imagine some asshole with a suitcase bomb wandering into CVS and blowing my ass straight to Hell. Even though the reality of suitcase nukes is debatable. IT COULD TOTALLY HAPPEN. AND THEN WE'RE FUCKED.
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes I'll watch the news, and the BREAKING NEWS icon will come up, and I'll be like, "Oh shit. This is it. CHICAGO IS NO MORE." And then it turns out some white chick is missing. What a tease. What if they bombed New York? Would my cell still work? Would my bank account still have money in it? Would the cable still be up? I am a very shallow person like that.
</p>
<p>
 I also root for a zombie holocaust because I look forward to the day when we beat the zombies and then are able to horde the remaining few inside a Zombie Zoo for our gawking amusement. How much would you pay to visit a zombie zoo? $50? I would, especially if they put it in San Diego.

  I sometimes like to imagine "Malkovich Style", that Ex-Girlfriends and friends that I haven't talked to in God knows how long can somehow have a real time sneak peak into my life, just to see how awesome I have become and what they are missing out on, by breaking up with me/not staying in touch in 5 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  But every time I think of this, and that they may be "peaking" into my life at that very moment, I am always doing something shitty such as just watching TV, making a frozen pizza, playing video games, etc, which makes me realize why they dumped my ass in the first place and that I really should be doing more with my life.

<p>
 Yes, but now you've got me completely freaked the fuck out. Because there's no reason some prick I only know on Facebook couldn't find a portal into my skull, wherein he spies on me banging my sheets. That's horrible. STAY OUT OF MY RIPE VESSEL, ERIC!
</p>
<p>
 Kidding aside, I rarely fear other people staring into my life. UNLESS THEY ARE DEAD. It terrifies me that everyone up in Heaven has those crazy God powers where they can see and hear everything. When someone dies, what's the first thing some fellow griever will say to you? "Well, I'm sure so and so is looking down at us all right now and smiling." Really? Jesus, that's creepy. Why is Aunt Harriet looking down at me? Shouldn't she have better things to do up in heaven, like playing air hockey with Lincoln? I'm not comfortable at all with this giant army of the dead looking down at me while I'm taking a shit or sneaking peeks at some Victoria Silvstedt crotch shot. That's not right. You dead fuckers have a lot of nerve. I wish the sky had Levlor blinds going across it.

  When I was a starving ex-student, me and my friends would often go to the dollar theater (back when it was actually a buck fifty to see the old releases). We never had money for snacks and never had the foresight to actually buy stuff and sneak it into the theater. Once inside, we would scrounge through the garbage cans in the theater and pull out the half eaten bags of popcorn, shake of a couple layers of corn and commence eating. You would be surprised how many bags of popcorn are barely touched, at least we hoped they weren't touched. It really seemed like a brilliant idea at the time.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 No one enjoys eating other people's leftovers as much as I do. I've picked up any number of half-full drinks at bars all across this land (FREE GIN!). But I draw the fucking line at thrown out movie popcorn. That is disgusting. First of all, you don't know if a penis has been in that bag. You don't. Someone easily could have pulled a Mickey Rourke and jammed their cock right up through the bag in an effort to get a hanj.
</p>
<p>
 Secondly, have you seen the other people at the movie theater? They're fucking repulsive. Movie theater people are almost as horrid as airport or bus station people. Any time I go to a movie theater, I want to gas at least 80% of the viewing audience. And that's even before they start talking during the fucking movie.
</p>
<p>
 Thirdly, few foods are eaten in as unsanitary fashion as popcorn. Think about how you eat popcorn. You jam your hand in the bag, cram it in your mouth, then dip your buttery, drooly fingers back down in the bag for another go. By the time you're halfway done, that entire bag is painted with your fucking mouthjuice. It's biohazard at that point.
</p>

 I worked as a table runner at a fancy restaurant once (same one with the

Talk about a failure of imagination! I'm actually disappointed that this criminal mastermind didn't use it to procure enriched uranium or bags of ammonium nitrate or a sword. It's not like I was going to have to pay for it anyway. What would you do a single credit card purchase and no concern with running into the law?

<p>
 It depends on the card. If it was an AmEx black card, or some rich asshole card that I knew had no credit limit, I'd go with buying a Bugatti all the way. You can buy one of those with a credit card, right? And no matching ID needed? I assume so.
</p>
<p>
 But if it's just some random credit card with an unknown credit limit, I'd have to make sure I bought something that didn't exceed the limit, otherwise I've wasted my opportunity. And something would be a really, really, really nice meal. At a restaurant I clearly can't afford. Champagne. Caviar. A steak sandwich and a steak sandwich. PUT IT ON THE UNDERHILLS, PLEASE.

 Drinking and watching TV in the common room. It wasn't until my senior year that our dorms got outfitted with cable in individual dorm rooms (Yes, I lived on campus senior year, which makes me a fucking loser). Before that, if you wanted to watch cable, you had to go the common room. And there was always some prick watching "Law &amp; Order" or something retarded down there. I used to go down, see who was watching TV, let out an audible sigh, and then constantly check back every fifteen minutes to see if they left. I was a real blast in college.

 The upside to that is that those straws are excellent for the whole "winding up and flicking so it pops" move. Man, that never gets old. I showed my kid that the other day. Happiest part of my week.

<p>
 The first songs that come immediately to mind are "Get In The Ring" and "Shotgun Blues." But it's not 1991 anymore, so I dunno if fighting to Axl bitching out Mick Wall of Kerrang would feel all that appropriate these days. Anyway, I'll pick the end of "Whole Lotta Rosie" for the dive bar, "Bottle of Smoke," by the Pogues at any pub, and the following song at a titty bar.

 Special thanks to reader William for the reccomendation. Consider that HALFTIME! "Piece of Me" by Skid Row also would have sufficed.

 <p>
  Since I can remember, I have always been amazed at my dad's ability to secure things in the back of a pick-up truck or on the roof of the car with one or two lengths of rope, using all manner of complicated knots and neatly arrayed criss-crossing patterns that not only held fantastically but then later came apart with ease. Same with my closest friends' dads. It was mind-boggling.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I graduated college and moved to friggin Japan and witnessed my Japanese girlfriend's dad do the same thing, I realized that this phenomenon might be greater than I could have imagined. Then the real questions came: is it ALL dads?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well, not anymore. Because I'm a dad, and 90% of the knots I tie come undone within three seconds of my tying them. I think old people back then were forced to join the Navy or something. That's one of the two pluses of being in the Navy: You learn to tie good knots, and you get to fuck a barrel.

  I sit in a cubicle for about 12 hours per day, needless to say, it blows. Not only is it mind-numbingly boring, but I have been forced to adopt a completely sedentary lifestyle. It's so bad that when my water cup runs out and I'm forced to walk to the break room to refill (approximately 80 feet round trip), I curse my superiors/the gods for not providing me with bigger cups.
 </p>
 <p>
  As it turns out, one of my coworkers is unwilling to accept this fate and has suggested that we sit on 75-centimeter yoga balls so that "our core muscles will be firing even when we are sitting." In this way we can combat a sedentary lifestyle while continuing to waste our prime fun-having years in a cubicle. Do you think health is worth sitting on a yoga ball?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 No. Listen, I know yoga balls are effective, and I have to do exercises with them for my back every other day, but I'd want nothing to do with them if I had a choice. There is no piece of equipment that simultaneously looks more fun yet causes more pain. Personal trainers have spent years finding ways to make your fucking life miserable by doing situps and pushups and God knows what else on a fucking yoga ball. It's horrible, and all I want to do when I see yoga balls is play dodgeball against a gang of friendly ogres. But does such a game ever materialize? NO! Instead, it's one backbreaking ab exercise after another.
</p>
<p>
 Office laziness and office ass are very real dangers in this world. But you can avoid both problems simply by smoking and doing lots of cocaine. Has to beat a yoga ball any day.

There is much wailing.

<p>
 But why not go all the way and just fantasize about being Jesus? Who's to say you aren't? I'm not saying I imagine this regularly, but I have considered the idea that I'd be taking a shower one day, and God would pop up and be like, "My child, you're the Second Coming. I'm your father. You have THE MARK." Then I look at my ass in the mirror and there's a birthmark in the shape of a cross or something. That would be fucked up. Me? You sure? Well, what do I do now? Am I gonna have to be crucified? I don't wanna do that. That sounds terrible.
</p>
<p>
 I've wondered, strictly from a secular perspective, what would happen if the Second Coming occurred one day. Like, I turn on CNN and suddenly there's Jesus, turning water into wine and crying blood.

I know damn well my face is a steak to them. If one tried to attack me, I know already what I would do. I would dig my thumb into his eye and try and stab his brain. Then I would beat the living FUCK out of the dog's fat lady owner.

There was slime sticking to the nail and my toe and it kinda turned into a wall of goo. Like in horror movies. Then the stench hit me. The newly removed nail and toe stunk to high heaven.

 When I encounter a magnetic knife strip (or anything magnetized), I will take the knife, and see how close I can get it to the magnet before feeling the magnet pull the fucker in. And then I'll see if I can hold the knife steady in that little tractor beam. Magnets are so fucking cool.

<p>
 But it needs to go further. It should be able to take that picture, then create a digital model of that person's face, and then superimpose it onto the face of a woman in a porno.

I've already included a heavy amount of Mastodon, Tool, and High on Fire but I'm unsure in what order to place the songs.

 Well, wait a second. There are any number of mitigating factors to this agreement. Did she agree reluctantly?

 Regardless, I suggest you get her stoned before you begin. Cook her a nice dinner, have some wine, fire up a joint, and then UNLEASH YOUR FUCKING AXE. Consider instrumentals to warm her up, so she's not distracted by some barking vocalist. A song like "Orion" by Metallica. Or any song by Pelican.

I don't know what I would do without it. Lot of people take it before they go to the bars to stay up all night too. The side-effects are shrunken penis (just while on it), no appetite, unknowingly grinding your teeth, and a terrible crash that I usually offset with weed and a couple 40s That's great way to celebrate being done with a test anyway.

 No appetite? That's a BAD side effect? I'd take it just for that.

 I don't think I even knew what Adderall was when I went to school. But now I would like to travel back in time so that I can attend school and use it as a study/party aid. Sure, any number of reputable media outlets have published reports that prescription drug use is now epidemic among college kids. But few of those reports appear to tell you just how apparently AWESOME those drugs can be. Kids I knew in school who crammed for tests used shit like No Doz and ephedra.

 for this. That movie convinced a lot of people that, if they were smart and shrewd enough, they could make it all the way to the top. And that is a LIE. No matter how smart and talented you are, there's always some retard above you who will hold your ass down. That's why work is bullshit. All I want is a 10,000 square foot corner office on the 60th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper, and one of those fancy Aeron chairs. And a $5 million a year salary, with a generous annual bonus. I don't think it's much to ask.

 Mike's fantasizing is equally shitty if you work in a field like advertising. Every time I was about to present an ad to my boss, I would think to myself, "THIS is the fucking ad. This is the one that wins all the awards, gets me invited to Cannes, jacks up my day rate to $3,000 a day, and gets me a creative director slot in Rio. THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN A ROY ROGERS AD QUITE LIKE THIS ONE." I'd imagine my boss taking one look at it and throwing his hands up. "Magary, you've outdone yourself. This is a fucking MASTERPIECE." Not only would I envision that, but I would become convinced that would be his exact reaction. And it never was. It was always, "Eh," or something equally devastating. You should see my face when that happens. I look like one of those dipshits that doesn't get picked for "American Idol". It's horrible. Know those scenes on "Mad Men" where Draper shits all over Sal and some poor writer's work, and forces them to go back to the drawing board? All too accurate. Only I never got to get loaded at lunch and be secretly gay.

 Do I have to watch the person poop? If I have to watch, then I'll take the vomit.

  One thing I've noticed in my office is that people with bring food in a PF Chang's or Cheesecake Factory bag, but it will be some homemade crap or a can of soup or something. Total BS in my opinion. Buy a freaking cooler or brown bag it instead of bringing a lunch under false pretenses.

<p>
 Even worse is when someone brings something like that home, like your wife. Whoa hey lady, you went to CPK? SCORE! Wait a second. These are just bananas! FIEND!

 I've also gotten presents wrapped in boxes from stores where the item was NOT purchased. My mom just happened to have a box from FAO Schwartz handy. This isn't a toy! It's a sweater! You misled me, woman!

  Have you ever heard about the "Marshmallow Test"? I've now read about it multiple times in reference to gauging intelligence in young children. Psychologists gave 4 yr olds a marshmallow and told them that they could either, A) "eat it now", or, B) wait a little while (like 15 or so minutes, not sure about this detail) before eating it and get a second marshmallow. If the kid ate the thing before the time was up they didn't get a second one. Only the kids that waited did. They then followed these kids for the next 14 years (approx) and found that the kids who waited to get the 2nd marshmallow scored, on average, 210 points higher on their SATs. I'm fascinated by this and wish I could go back in time just to take this test and I don't even like marshmallows.
 </p>

<p>
 But what about kids who took the marshmallow right away, and then bitched and moaned for a second one until the adult finally broke down, caved in, and gave them the whole bag, like a goddamn sucker? Kids like that will go far.
</p>
<p>
 The actual marshmallow test makes sense. If you're a kid who is impatient, fat, and cannot comprehend how to secure an extra marshmallow, chances are you're fucking stupid. And now I want marshmallows. Right now. NO WAY I'M WAITING, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF CARROT OR MARSHMALLOW YOU DANGLE IN FRONT OF ME.

  I tend to enjoy cans of soup for lunch, and I've made the following progression in how I eat the soup (or, regression):
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Pour soup in bowl, microwave, enjoy hot. Like a normal adult that does not live in a trainyard.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Pour soup in bowl, enjoy cold. Acceptable, as utensils and dishware is featured heavily.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Enjoy right out of can, hobo style. Spoon optional.
 </p>
 <p>
  Is this OK? No bowl to clean, no balancing act of carrying the 99% full bowl of piping-hot soup back to my desk, along the way invariably spilling it on myself, leading to searing burns and cursing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or, should I worry about my boss or boss' boss stumbling into my office seeing me chug a can of Chunky Sirloin with Country Vegetables like it's an ice cold Budweiser?
 </p>

<p>
 This is Chunky Soup? Doesn't a cold can have little bits of congealed fat on top? I understand the appeal of just eating it right out of the can (it makes me feel like I'm in
 <em>
  Mad Max
 </em>
 ), but that's to be done at home. I think, in public, you have to use the bowl.
</p>
<p>
 NOTE: Whenever I open a can of soup that has a peel-back tab, I cannot avoid spattering myself when I open it. I'll pop it open, peel the lid back, and when it gets to that point where the lid is still just barely connected to the can, POP! It comes off and I have Spaghetti-O shit all over me. So now I only open the an halfway, then I stuff the lid down into the can when I'm done pouring my shit out. Let that be a lesson to you cans.

 We end today with a GREAT MOMENT IN POOP HISTORY.

  I was about nine years old and had a neighborhood friend. Let's call him "Kevin." I was over at Kevin's house one particular afternoon playing in his Jacuzzi. We were behaving as nine year olds do, playing grab-ass, seeing who could hold their breath the longest, etc. In the excitement of being able to frolick in this watery playground (I felt like King Triton!), I neglected to realize that I had to take a dump. Badly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I knew it the torpedo was out of the tube. Fortunately for me, I was wearing a bathing suit with the mesh underwear that trapped the turd like a dolphin in tuna nets. Embarrassed, and afraid to get out, I reached down the back of my shorts and grabbed the log, and when Kevin wasn't looking I threw it in the filter trap. I then declared, "We should get out." We did, and I thought I was the smartest fucking kid alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  A few days later I was back over at Kevin's and apparently my deed had not gone unnoticed. Kevin's dad asked me repeatedly if I had, "taken a dump in his Jacuzzi," which I summarily denied. Apparently he had done the same thing to Kevin and knew it had to be one of us, but neither was admitting it. He eventually stopped the inquisition and I was able to go play G.I. Joes or some shit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next week Kevin was over at my house (we were BFFs!) and we were having ourselves a Micro Machine war. Kevin informed me that he had to go to the bathroom, and I didn't think much of it. He came back a few minutes later and we continued to play until he had to leave. After he left, my mom walked into the bathroom he had used and uttered words I will never forget: "I think Kevin missed the toilet...completely." I ran to where she was looking and there, smack dab on the middle of the bathroom floor, was a steaming pile of shit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Either on his own volition or at his dad's instruction, Kevin had decided that my spa dump had marred the family name. I was revenge pooped.

 Get that dad a beer.
