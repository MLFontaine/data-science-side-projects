 I went to park my car the other day and the spot I parked in had a parking meter that was out of order. It is ILLEGAL to park in a spot with a meter that's out of order. You'll get a ticket. I cannot tell you how angry this makes me. It's not my fucking fault the meter is out of order. And now we have to leave a perfectly nice parking spot empty just because the meter is broken. Bullshit. BULLSHIT.
</p>
<p>
 For once, I'd like to see a local government have a goddamn sense of levity and say, "You know what? If a parking meter is out of order, the spot is free." Just one extremely small act of kindness is a goddamn sea of petty bullshit. Now I know the countering argument here: "But if they did that, then everyone would just stick gum in the coin slot of their meters so they didn't have to pay!" I see nothing wrong with such a strategy. Kudos to you if you have the ingenuity to break a parking meter to avoid feeding it 75 cents.
</p>
<p>
 Two last things about parking meters. Ever have a meter not register the quarter you put in it? Ruins my fucking day. The flipside to that: parking in a spot and realizing there's still an hour or two left on the meter from when someone parked there last. God, that's a fantastic feeling. I feel like I just robbed a CoinStar machine when that happens. Anyway, your letters.

<p>
 Well, I assume the answer to the first question is that some celebrities probably HAVE died from AIDS, but haven't publicly disclosed it. I mean, look at the dude Brittany Murphy was banging when she died. That guy looks like a seven-layer AIDS taco.
</p>
<p>
 It does amaze me that the last major celebrity to die from AIDS, at least to my immediate recollection, was Eazy-E. That was 15 years ago. We're overdue for a splurge in celebrity AIDS deaths. Maybe Magic, Robbie Alomar and Tommy Morrison will all go in a single two-month stretch down the pike. I wonder if there's some kind of trifecta ticket you can purchase if you'd like to wager on such an occurrence. It's not like celebrities are any more responsible these days. They're celebrities. They're retards.
</p>
<p>
 There's one other explanation for this: AIDS DOESN'T REALLY EXIST AND WAS INVENTED BY THE GAYS TO PUSH FORWARD THEIR HIDEOUS GAYGENDA, WHICH INVOLVES POISONING OUR WATER SUPPLIES AND INFECTING US WITH THE GAY. But that theory still needs testing.

  I was in Ireland a few years ago, and at that time, McDonald's throughout the UK and Ireland were serving a seasonal Cadbury Creme Egg McFlurry. It was, obviously, amazing, but the idea hasn't caught on in the United States. If I were to walk into my local Dairy Queen and hand them a few creme eggs and maybe something for the kitchen, do you think I could get them to hook me up with a Cadbury Creme Egg blizzard?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 I'm sorry Ben, but I just blacked out from visualizing such a McFlurry and then having a 10-minute orgasm. I've seen Cr&egrave;me Egg omelets and
 <a href="http://www.blog.montgomerie.net/creme-egg-brownies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

 but a Cr&egrave;me Egg blizzard would deserve its own wing of the Smithsonian. I MUST HAVE IT. In fact, I have no clue why Dairy Queen (I'm going to shift over to Dairy Queen for the rest of this discussion, since Blizzards are inherently better than McFlurries) doesn't do a Cr&egrave;me Egg Blizzard OR a Reese's Peanut Butter Egg Blizzard. A peanut butter cup Blizzard may be close enough, but I'd like to see the unholy use of the full peanut butter egg. Also, consider this: a chocolate Blizzard with bits of marshmallow Peeps. I'd stick my dick in that.

  One of my favorite things to do when I'm walking the dog in winter time is to look for brittle ice. It often accumulates at the edges of the sidewalk most commonly during the beginning and end of winter. Brain cues Blue Oyster Cult and the prehistoric metallic screech, I am Godzilla! The noises this stuff makes when you crush it are so totally satisfying. It sounds like breaking stained glass windows, ripping, crushing violence, BEHOLD MY STOMPING POWER.

 I concur. Stomping the shit out of brittle ice is awesome. I see that thin white layer of ice and I practically break out running, so I can be the first one to dig my heel into it. I like to pretend I'm a World War II soldier putting his boot in a German's skull. THIS ONE IS FOR THE JEWS, YOU KRAUT FUCK.

 I have kids now, which means I have to share whatever brittle ice I find with them. They get to have first crack at it. But they never do the job to my satisfaction. It's always, "Okay, kid. Game effort. Now let me show you how a REAL FUCKING MAN takes care of this shit." STOMP STOMP STOMP.

  Whenever I'm at a gas station or fast food place that has the little TV where I can see myself on the security camera, I always stare at it.

The reality is that every time I look like the tall, gangly, unintimidating guy with bad posture that I am. It's disappointing.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 It always captures me at a profile, so I always try and turn my head so I can see my whole face, while keeping my eyes fixed on the camera, so I end up looking at footage of myself with my pupils facing my right ear. I also try and extend my neck, so that my chin doesn't look so fat.
</p>
<p>
 I also wave my hand whenever I see the monitor. This is so I can say hi to myself ("Hi, me!"), and so I can verify that it's me on the monitor. Hey, is that me on the TV? Let me wave my hand to see and&hellip; YES! It is! I'm on TV! Jesus, I look pale! Then I fix my hair. It's a human reaction. If I see that I'm on a TV somewhere, I can't not look. I don't have the capacity to do something like that. I have to know what I really look like. This is what I look like when I move. This is how people really see me when I'm in public. Oh God, I look like a fucking retard.
</p>
<p>
 Even worse than the monitor is the giant round mirror they deploy in 7-11 to keep 13-year-olds from stealing issues of Club International. Those mirrors have fish eye distortion, so I always walk to the exact center spot of the mirror and then bob my head to either side, to create the illusion that I'm starring in an old Hype Williams video.

 Oh, that's terrible. Perhaps the partners intended to design the urinal this way, as a way of always having a chip on their shoulder.

 That's your body's way of delaying work. I also piss right before going into any kind of work assignment that doesn't require manual labor. Like taxes. I'm just gonna sit down here and do my taxes. I'm all set to go! Wait, wait. Better piss first, just to give myself three extra seconds before the endless drudgery of life begins in earnest.
</p>
<p>
 I like to sit down to work, then piss, then sit back down, then get some thing to eat, then sit back down, then go get something to drink, then sit down, and then go piss again. If I play my cards right, I can repeat that cycle at least nine times before even opening Turbotax. And, by that point, the day is nearly over. I may as well wait another day. BOOSH!

  All the time I used to come home from school, reach into my backpack, out of which I would pull a 3 1/2 inch floppy disk. Oh, but this disk did not contain some mundane homework assignment, paper, or even video game. On this disk was any number of one of the following: 1) A virus, meant to destroy the mainframe of computers of whatever organization or country I was infiltrating, 2) Some sort of top secret profile, either my personal Agent information or the man I have been sent to assassinate, or 3) Some sort of plans, architectural most likely, to any number of things. Most often it was similar to the scene from Star Wars where Darth Vader is demanding that Leia turn over the plans - except I have them, not R2D2! Quick, to the Apple IIGS!
 </p>
 <p>
  The best part about this was the mechanical and tactile nature of the 3 1/2 inch floppy, something totally lost in CDs, and only poorly approximated in thumb drives. At best using a thumb drive just makes you feel like a low level hacker.

<p>
 Agreed, though it's well worth losing that mild thrill in exchange for things like, I dunno, the Internet. I don't think I'd like to go back to that era.
</p>
<p>
 I remember when I was a kid that we had a computer that took real floppy disks, the ones that were actually floppy. Then they came out with the next generation of floppy disks, the hard plastic ones, and that was like a fucking quantum leap. ZOMG! The disks are smaller! IT'S LIKE WE LIVE IN THE FUTURE! I used to take my Dad's hard floppy disks and play with the metal part that slid back and forth. It was on a spring, so you could slide it to the side to expose the disk, then release it and it would SNAP shut. I did that, like, 900 times in row. I ruined any number of disks doing it.

 DAD: Have you been in here, messing with my computer stuff?

 Yesterday, a new memory chip arrived for my piece of shit iMac. I installed it myself, and you better believe I treated that installation like I was the nerdy guy in a bank robbing crew who breaks into the mainframe and swaps out the main chip with one that tells the computer to let my crew and I bust into the vault any time we wish. The installment took roughly five minutes. I kinda wish it had been more involved. I AM A MASTER OF HARDWARE.

  Can we all band together as a nation and decide that "Prime Time" television programming on Sundays in the winter months should begin at 5:00?

I think this is a reasonable request.

 Obviously, this discussion is moot if you own a DVR, because then prime time is anytime you like.

That shit is all filler and everyone knows it. Instead of that, they should always air one of the first two

 It really is amazing the lengths you'll go to showcase your musical tastes. The worst is when other people are in my car. I feel this urgent need to dazzle them with my DJ skillz.

Okay, so it was a football teammate who didn't really like me all that much who I hung around anyway because I thought he was cool (again, junior year of college, when most kids are well past doing those sorts of things). So he and his friend are there and we're all playing

 I was absolutely crushed. But that's precisely what I get for somehow assuming that liking a certain band somehow makes me a more inherently interesting person.

So I basically shower for a few days trying to salvage some sort of soapy water to wash myself with. Why can't I just remember to put the goddamn new bottle in the shower once I detect the slightest indication that the starter is running out of gas? I am the Dusty Baker of Irish Spring Body Wash.

<p>
 That also goes for shampoo. It takes me a good week to remember there's no fucking shampoo in the shower, which means I end up using my wife's for long stretches. And this annoys her, because her shampoo is designed strictly for HER hair, what with its volumizing and highlight-retaining ingredients. I'm never the one to replace the shampoo. It's always my lady who replaces it for me, because I am a child and need things done for me. More than once, in college, I would run out of shampoo and then rub a bar of soap on my head. Do not shampoo with bar soap. It does not produce the sort of body one is looking for.
</p>
<p>
 Chris is right about never getting out of the shower mid-shower. That is a horrible thing when you have to do it. You're wet, and cold, and dripping all over the fucking place. Ever shower and then realize there's no towel in the bathroom? That is one of the worst feelings in existence.

  In this age of 500+ cable channels, internet, etc., what singular event would have to be broadcast on TV in America to get 80% of our populace to watch it? The first thing that came to mind was the execution of Osama bin Laden. My friends, on the other hand, think even this wouldn't get the job done, and that anything short of aliens landing in New York and holding a press conference would fail the test. Thoughts?
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Well, do you mean on one channel? Because bin Laden's execution would be covered by many channels, of course. And even then, it's tough to get 300 million people all watching simultaneously. Obama's election netted 71 million viewers, which doesn't even come close. Nor did the last Super Bowl (actually on just one channel), which got 106.5 million.
</p>
<p>
 Still, I think there could be events that would attract that kind of audience, most of them tragic. I can't find any stats for how many people "watched" 9/11, but I don't know anyone who wasn't watching it on television as it occurred. I remember that day that even the non-news channels like MTV switched to sister network news feeds to cover the attacks. Any television turned on was watching the attacks, because no alternate programming was on.
</p>
<p>
 So if something like 9/11 happened again, like a fucking nuke going off in an American town, I think you could get 80 percent of Americans to watch it. Imagine the handful of assholes that wouldn't watch it. What dicks they must be. "What's that? Someone nuked Washington? Well, I don't give a shit. Where the fuck is Scooby Doo?"
</p>
<p>
 The rest of the list for such an event would have to be as follows:
</p>
<p>
 &bull; First contact with aliens
 <br/>
 &bull; Second Coming
 <br/>
 &bull; Elvis actually alive, holds press conference/concert
 <br/>
 &bull; Tiger Woods climbs to top of Empire State Building, threatens to jump off, DOES jump off

 &bull; Presidential assassination
 <br/>
 &bull; President murders someone and it is caught on tape (I've always wanted that to happen, regardless of President)
